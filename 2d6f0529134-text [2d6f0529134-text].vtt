MARK CUBAN: As my dad
would always tell me,

00:28.550 --> 00:32.200 align:middle line:84%
your-- your most valuable
asset is your time.

00:32.200 --> 00:34.180 align:middle line:90%
And it's perishable.

00:43.340 --> 00:46.580 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to make enough
money so that I didn't have

00:46.580 --> 00:49.760 align:middle line:90%
to respond to anybody else.

00:49.760 --> 00:53.600 align:middle line:84%
I could set my own schedule
and live my own life the way

00:53.600 --> 00:56.740 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to do it.

00:56.740 --> 00:59.020 align:middle line:84%

everyone who ever

01:29.250 --> 01:30.990 align:middle line:90%

I think about starting
companies a lot.

01:56.440 --> 02:01.588 align:middle line:84%
We all have had that idea where
you start thinking about it,

02:01.588 --> 02:03.880 align:middle line:84%
and you get that little
feeling in your stomach, right,

02:03.880 --> 02:06.190 align:middle line:84%
where you get-- you feel
that nervous energy.

02:06.190 --> 02:07.760 align:middle line:84%
It was like, oh,
this could be good.

02:07.760 --> 02:10.000 align:middle line:84%
So then you go online,
and you Google it,

02:10.000 --> 02:12.250 align:middle line:84%
and you think, oh,
it's not there.

02:12.250 --> 02:14.453 align:middle line:84%
This might be a--
a decent business.

02:14.453 --> 02:16.870 align:middle line:84%
Then you talk to your family,
your friends-- they're like,

02:16.870 --> 02:18.610 align:middle line:90%
that's a great idea.

02:18.610 --> 02:20.380 align:middle line:84%
You should do
something with that.

02:20.380 --> 02:22.360 align:middle line:84%
Almost all of us have
been through that.

02:22.360 --> 02:26.440 align:middle line:90%
But 99.99% of us stop.

The hard part of
starting a business

02:28.300 --> 02:32.720 align:middle line:84%
is making the commitment because
you've got to be able to say,

02:32.720 --> 02:35.620 align:middle line:84%
this is my life before
I was an entrepreneur,

02:35.620 --> 02:38.938 align:middle line:84%
and this is my life once
I became an entrepreneur,

02:38.938 --> 02:40.480 align:middle line:84%
and they're night
and day difference.

02:40.480 --> 02:42.647 align:middle line:84%
And you've gotta be willing
to make that commitment.

To be successful,
the fundamentals

02:52.340 --> 02:54.770 align:middle line:90%
are sales margins and profits.

02:54.770 --> 02:56.780 align:middle line:84%
That's what make a
business successful.

02:56.780 --> 02:58.190 align:middle line:90%
That's what's important.

02:58.190 --> 03:00.140 align:middle line:84%
That's all you
should be focused on.

03:00.140 --> 03:04.190 align:middle line:84%
I think where people get lost
is they think there are metrics

03:04.190 --> 03:06.650 align:middle line:84%
that are standard
across the industry

03:06.650 --> 03:08.540 align:middle line:84%
that they have to
do better than.

03:08.540 --> 03:11.930 align:middle line:84%
The reality is you've got
to figure these things out

03:11.930 --> 03:14.390 align:middle line:84%
as you go and always
trying to be optimized.

03:14.390 --> 03:17.150 align:middle line:84%
What you've got to do
is continuously test.

03:17.150 --> 03:19.910 align:middle line:84%
A business is an
ongoing evaluation

03:19.910 --> 03:21.770 align:middle line:90%
of all your processes.

03:21.770 --> 03:26.930 align:middle line:84%
Every business has
indicators that determine

03:26.930 --> 03:28.970 align:middle line:90%
the health of their business.

03:28.970 --> 03:31.820 align:middle line:84%
More often than not,
it's sales, but how

03:31.820 --> 03:34.220 align:middle line:84%
do you get those sales
and at what cost?

03:34.220 --> 03:37.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's a key
performance indicator.

03:37.160 --> 03:38.150 align:middle line:90%
They call them KPIs.

03:38.150 --> 03:39.770 align:middle line:90%
I hate acronyms.

03:39.770 --> 03:41.870 align:middle line:90%
I hate all the buzzwords--

03:41.870 --> 03:44.240 align:middle line:90%
KPIs, CAC, RAC.

Oh, my god-- drives me crazy.

You have to
continuously evaluate

03:48.690 --> 03:51.570 align:middle line:84%
it and rather than
worry about your KPIs,

03:51.570 --> 03:55.240 align:middle line:84%
your key performance
indicators, always ask yourself,

03:55.240 --> 03:57.570 align:middle line:84%
what is it that I
can do to improve?

03:57.570 --> 03:59.880 align:middle line:90%
Now, do I do business plans?

03:59.880 --> 04:01.520 align:middle line:90%

04:01.520 --> 04:02.720 align:middle line:90%
I did.

04:02.720 --> 04:03.920 align:middle line:90%
I wrote it all out.

04:03.920 --> 04:05.390 align:middle line:90%
I did the copypasta.

I found a business plan.

04:07.190 --> 04:10.560 align:middle line:90%
I filled it all in--

04:10.560 --> 04:14.610 align:middle line:84%
did me no good because
the reality is business

04:14.610 --> 04:15.540 align:middle line:90%
is a process.

04:15.540 --> 04:17.399 align:middle line:90%
Business is non-stop.

04:17.399 --> 04:19.019 align:middle line:90%
It is always changing.

There's a competitor out
there trying to kick your ass,

04:21.600 --> 04:24.210 align:middle line:84%

me, I'm trying to kick your ass.

Writing a business
plan is an awful just

04:26.820 --> 04:29.580 align:middle line:84%
to give you a
foundation to refer to,

04:29.580 --> 04:34.890 align:middle line:84%
but the worst thing you can
do is write a business plan,

04:34.890 --> 04:37.950 align:middle line:84%
and then as you're running
your business and things

04:37.950 --> 04:40.530 align:middle line:84%
start to change,
say, I'm doing this

04:40.530 --> 04:42.270 align:middle line:84%
because I wrote it
in my business plan,

04:42.270 --> 04:43.740 align:middle line:84%
and that's why I'm
going to do it.

anything you've ever written

05:13.850 --> 05:16.550 align:middle line:84%
My first real business
was selling garbage bags

05:16.550 --> 05:19.130 align:middle line:84%
door to door, and
the business plan

05:19.130 --> 05:22.160 align:middle line:84%
was to make enough
money to buy myself--

05:22.160 --> 05:24.260 align:middle line:90%
I think it was Bata Bullets.

05:24.260 --> 05:25.980 align:middle line:90%
I was a hooper back then, right?

05:25.980 --> 05:29.650 align:middle line:84%
As a 12-year-old, basketball
was always my favorite sport.

05:29.650 --> 05:31.730 align:middle line:84%
And I want-- I wanted
the best shoes, I mean,

05:31.730 --> 05:33.440 align:middle line:90%
because hooper's gotta hoop.

05:33.440 --> 05:35.750 align:middle line:84%
So how does a 12-year-old
start a business

05:35.750 --> 05:37.850 align:middle line:84%
of going door to door
with garbage bags?

05:37.850 --> 05:40.160 align:middle line:84%
First, it starts with
my dad's poker night.

05:40.160 --> 05:42.440 align:middle line:84%
My dad would always
have his buddies over,

05:42.440 --> 05:45.320 align:middle line:84%
and I would go in
there and steal a donut

05:45.320 --> 05:47.420 align:middle line:84%
and just talk to him
and talk to his buddies.

05:47.420 --> 05:49.147 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't really
understand it then,

05:49.147 --> 05:51.230 align:middle line:84%
but they were probably
trashed out of their minds.

05:51.230 --> 05:55.670 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him if I could get
a new pair of basketball shoes,

05:55.670 --> 05:57.980 align:middle line:84%
and he looked at
me, and he said,

05:57.980 --> 06:01.400 align:middle line:84%
"As long as those shoes
on your feet work, no.

06:01.400 --> 06:04.200 align:middle line:84%
But when you get a job, you
can buy whatever you want."

06:04.200 --> 06:05.840 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, Dad,
I'm 12 years old.

06:05.840 --> 06:07.250 align:middle line:90%
How am I going to get a job?

06:07.250 --> 06:10.370 align:middle line:84%
One of his buddies spoke up
and said, I got a job for you.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.750 align:middle line:84%
I've got all these
boxes of garbage bags

06:12.750 --> 06:14.040 align:middle line:90%
that need to be sold.

06:14.040 --> 06:16.530 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you go around in the
neighborhood and sell them?

06:16.530 --> 06:18.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, okay, I can do that.

06:18.960 --> 06:20.850 align:middle line:84%
When you're starting
a company, there

06:20.850 --> 06:23.430 align:middle line:84%
are some fundamental
things that you have to do.

06:23.430 --> 06:25.920 align:middle line:84%
You have to know
what your costs are.

06:25.920 --> 06:29.130 align:middle line:84%
You have to know how much
you can sell something for,

06:29.130 --> 06:31.050 align:middle line:90%
and can you make a profit?

06:31.050 --> 06:35.190 align:middle line:84%
I bought the boxes of 100
garbage bags for $3 each.

06:35.190 --> 06:37.560 align:middle line:90%
I sold them for $6 each.

06:37.560 --> 06:40.502 align:middle line:84%
When you buy a box or whatever--
cart of garbage bags--

06:40.502 --> 06:41.460 align:middle line:90%
you got to schlep them.

06:41.460 --> 06:42.793 align:middle line:90%
You've got to carry them, right?

06:42.793 --> 06:45.300 align:middle line:84%
So if I solved those two
problems, where I made it easy,

06:45.300 --> 06:47.217 align:middle line:84%
and you don't have to
carry those garbage bags

06:47.217 --> 06:49.260 align:middle line:84%
home from the grocery
store or whatever,

06:49.260 --> 06:52.200 align:middle line:84%
and I saved you some
time, and time is money,

06:52.200 --> 06:55.750 align:middle line:84%
would it be worth 6
bucks to your neighbor?

06:55.750 --> 06:57.960 align:middle line:90%
Imagine this 12-year-old face.

06:57.960 --> 06:59.970 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it was-- it
was going to work.

06:59.970 --> 07:03.170 align:middle line:90%
And so here's how it went.

07:03.170 --> 07:06.980 align:middle line:84%
To my neighbor's door--
hi, my name is Mark.

07:06.980 --> 07:10.440 align:middle line:90%
Do you use garbage bags?

07:10.440 --> 07:11.730 align:middle line:90%
Now, who's going to say no?

07:11.730 --> 07:14.820 align:middle line:84%
And so it was that simple,
and the next thing you know,

07:14.820 --> 07:17.683 align:middle line:84%
I had-- not only did I have
the world's first garbage bag

07:17.683 --> 07:19.350 align:middle line:84%
route, probably the
world's first, only,

07:19.350 --> 07:21.480 align:middle line:84%
and last garbage
bag route, but I

07:21.480 --> 07:22.860 align:middle line:90%
had enough money for my shoes.

07:22.860 --> 07:27.540 align:middle line:84%
What I took away from that
was I learned how to sell.

07:27.540 --> 07:30.060 align:middle line:84%
And it was the greatest
lesson I could ever

07:30.060 --> 07:33.330 align:middle line:84%
learn because there's never
been a successful company

07:33.330 --> 07:37.230 align:middle line:84%
in the history of companies
that didn't need sales.

07:37.230 --> 07:41.400 align:middle line:84%
I learned that selling
was not convincing.

07:41.400 --> 07:44.010 align:middle line:84%
It's not all the cliches
you hear about selling.

07:44.010 --> 07:45.630 align:middle line:90%
Selling is helping.

07:45.630 --> 07:48.900 align:middle line:84%
Selling is putting yourself
in the shoes of the person

07:48.900 --> 07:50.910 align:middle line:84%
or company you're
trying to sell to

07:50.910 --> 07:53.610 align:middle line:84%
and understanding
what their needs are

07:53.610 --> 07:57.360 align:middle line:84%
and finding a way to fill their
needs, solve that problem,

07:57.360 --> 08:00.780 align:middle line:84%
support whatever it is
that they need to do.

08:00.780 --> 08:02.640 align:middle line:90%
I figured it out at 12.

08:02.640 --> 08:04.410 align:middle line:90%

I've been called a
disruptor many times.

08:13.840 --> 08:17.320 align:middle line:84%
To me, what a disruptor
is is somebody

08:17.320 --> 08:20.260 align:middle line:84%
who looks at the way things
have always been done

08:20.260 --> 08:21.790 align:middle line:90%

08:21.790 --> 08:22.930 align:middle line:90%
I can do it better.

08:22.930 --> 08:24.790 align:middle line:84%
I think people can
learn to be disruptors.

08:24.790 --> 08:27.700 align:middle line:84%
I really do because
being a disruptor

08:27.700 --> 08:31.360 align:middle line:84%

level of knowledge that

08:31.360 --> 08:32.350 align:middle line:90%
gives you an edge.

08:32.350 --> 08:37.809 align:middle line:84%
It's not necessarily about
being a great technologist.

08:37.809 --> 08:43.000 align:middle line:84%
It's not necessarily about
having some unique skill set.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.460 align:middle line:84%
It's really about
being somebody who

08:45.460 --> 08:49.750 align:middle line:84%
absorbs a lot of information
and who loves to learn

08:49.750 --> 08:52.240 align:middle line:84%
and is able to take
disparate pieces

08:52.240 --> 08:55.090 align:middle line:84%
and say, well, if I take some
of that, some of that, some

08:55.090 --> 08:57.430 align:middle line:84%
of that, I can
solve this problem

08:57.430 --> 08:59.920 align:middle line:84%
or create this
opportunity or create

08:59.920 --> 09:03.460 align:middle line:84%
this new situation that
other people aren't seeing.

09:03.460 --> 09:06.730 align:middle line:84%
And whether that
was micro solutions,

09:06.730 --> 09:10.370 align:middle line:84%
where we were the second or
third local area networking

09:10.370 --> 09:11.750 align:middle line:90%
integrator in the country--

09:11.750 --> 09:13.520 align:middle line:84%
it was the early
days of PCS, and I

09:13.520 --> 09:15.230 align:middle line:84%
remember going into
companies and saying,

09:15.230 --> 09:16.700 align:middle line:90%
look, here's what we want to do.

09:16.700 --> 09:19.025 align:middle line:84%
You have one PC there, one
PC there, and one PC there.

09:19.025 --> 09:20.900 align:middle line:84%
We're just going to
connect them all together

09:20.900 --> 09:22.460 align:middle line:90%
and connect a printer.

09:22.460 --> 09:24.020 align:middle line:84%
It's called a
local area network,

09:24.020 --> 09:25.283 align:middle line:90%
so everybody can print.

09:25.283 --> 09:27.200 align:middle line:84%
And they'd be like, why--
why do we need that?

09:27.200 --> 09:29.570 align:middle line:84%
We'll take our floppy disk,
and I'll just carry it over.

09:29.570 --> 09:31.670 align:middle line:84%
In hindsight, it always
makes perfect sense.

09:31.670 --> 09:33.710 align:middle line:84%
The best disruptions
in hindsight

09:33.710 --> 09:35.870 align:middle line:90%
always seem so obvious.

09:35.870 --> 09:38.120 align:middle line:84%
Internet broadcasting,
the broadcast network

09:38.120 --> 09:40.160 align:middle line:84%
on the internet--
seems so obvious now.

09:40.160 --> 09:41.210 align:middle line:90%
It was just streaming.

09:41.210 --> 09:45.740 align:middle line:84%
HDNet in 2000, the first all
high definition TV network--

09:45.740 --> 09:47.600 align:middle line:90%
it seems so obvious now.

09:47.600 --> 09:49.370 align:middle line:84%
None of those
businesses actually

09:49.370 --> 09:54.140 align:middle line:84%
took some earth-shattering,
groundbreaking, technological

09:54.140 --> 09:54.920 align:middle line:90%
change.

09:54.920 --> 09:57.980 align:middle line:84%
It took taking a bunch of
pieces together and integrating

09:57.980 --> 10:00.200 align:middle line:84%
them to make them
work, which wasn't easy

10:00.200 --> 10:03.710 align:middle line:84%
and was time-consuming,
but that's what it was.

10:03.710 --> 10:05.300 align:middle line:90%
It was time to figure it out.

10:05.300 --> 10:07.280 align:middle line:84%
I think one of my
greatest skills

10:07.280 --> 10:12.530 align:middle line:84%
is that I love, love,
love to learn, love it.

10:12.530 --> 10:15.980 align:middle line:84%
Like, when I come across
an article or a book

10:15.980 --> 10:20.060 align:middle line:84%
or a video or a podcast,
where I can pick up

10:20.060 --> 10:23.390 align:middle line:84%
some new information, I
get all giddy and excited

10:23.390 --> 10:27.950 align:middle line:84%
inside because from
that, who knows what

10:27.950 --> 10:30.198 align:middle line:90%
opportunities I can create?

10:30.198 --> 10:32.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's typically where
disruptions come from.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

10:35.912 --> 10:36.855 align:middle line:90%


10:36.855 --> 10:38.480 align:middle line:84%
One of the most
important things that's

10:38.480 --> 10:41.360 align:middle line:84%
allowed me to be
successful is I can

10:41.360 --> 10:44.210 align:middle line:84%
look at a balance sheet or
income statement and read it.

10:44.210 --> 10:45.680 align:middle line:90%
I can look at a marketing plan.

10:45.680 --> 10:47.360 align:middle line:84%
I can put together
a marketing plan.

10:47.360 --> 10:50.330 align:middle line:84%
I can understand
statistics and the impact

10:50.330 --> 10:51.710 align:middle line:90%
they have on decision-making.

10:51.710 --> 10:54.113 align:middle line:84%
Those are all things
I can do for myself.

10:54.113 --> 10:56.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, could you hire
people to do those things?

10:56.030 --> 10:56.540 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

10:56.540 --> 10:59.270 align:middle line:84%
But when you're
starting a business,

10:59.270 --> 11:01.490 align:middle line:84%
it's a whole lot more
efficient, and you

11:01.490 --> 11:04.250 align:middle line:84%
can move a whole lot faster
when you can do it yourself.

11:04.250 --> 11:06.860 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's where
I'm different than a lot

11:06.860 --> 11:07.880 align:middle line:90%
of entrepreneurs.

11:07.880 --> 11:11.360 align:middle line:84%
I don't have the approach of,
okay, let's take the money,

11:11.360 --> 11:13.130 align:middle line:84%
go hire a bunch of
people, get an office,

11:13.130 --> 11:14.270 align:middle line:90%
all that-- not that at all.

11:14.270 --> 11:16.130 align:middle line:84%
It's, I'm going
to figure it out.

11:16.130 --> 11:17.430 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you an example.

11:17.430 --> 11:20.810 align:middle line:84%
If advertising online is
critical to the growth

11:20.810 --> 11:23.240 align:middle line:84%
of your business,
you have to learn it,

11:23.240 --> 11:25.130 align:middle line:90%
and I'm going to tell you why.

11:25.130 --> 11:29.827 align:middle line:84%
In a digital world, where we're
buying and selling ads online,

11:29.827 --> 11:31.160 align:middle line:90%
the company you're buying from--

11:31.160 --> 11:33.050 align:middle line:84%
Google, Facebook,
whatever it may be--

11:33.050 --> 11:35.810 align:middle line:84%
they're continuously
adjusting their algorithms.

11:35.810 --> 11:37.910 align:middle line:84%
They're continuously
changing because they're

11:37.910 --> 11:40.410 align:middle line:84%
trying to maximize
their returns as well.

11:40.410 --> 11:42.980 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a
never-ending battle--

11:42.980 --> 11:45.380 align:middle line:84%
and I truly mean
the word, "battle--"

11:45.380 --> 11:47.690 align:middle line:84%
to see-- they're trying to
see how much of your money

11:47.690 --> 11:50.690 align:middle line:84%
they can get for every
ad that they sell,

11:50.690 --> 11:52.880 align:middle line:84%
and you're trying to
see how many sales you

11:52.880 --> 11:57.440 align:middle line:84%
get for every ad you buy and
trying to make that profitable.

11:57.440 --> 12:00.590 align:middle line:84%
So there's a constant push-pull
that's forever changing.

12:00.590 --> 12:02.960 align:middle line:84%
Part of the
challenges you have--

12:02.960 --> 12:07.330 align:middle line:84%
and this applies to every
company I've ever invested in--

12:07.330 --> 12:09.940 align:middle line:84%
because it's not
easy to understand

12:09.940 --> 12:12.100 align:middle line:84%
how all those
algorithms break down,

12:12.100 --> 12:14.440 align:middle line:84%
we tend to go out
there and hire people.

12:14.440 --> 12:15.910 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going
to say that's bad

12:15.910 --> 12:18.310 align:middle line:84%
all the time because it's
hard to learn that stuff,

12:18.310 --> 12:22.000 align:middle line:84%
but you have to realize
that most people who

12:22.000 --> 12:25.490 align:middle line:84%
are trying to tell you
they can do your SEO,

12:25.490 --> 12:27.860 align:middle line:84%
you're probably,
particularly as a start-up,

12:27.860 --> 12:30.110 align:middle line:90%
you're this important to them.

12:30.110 --> 12:33.110 align:middle line:84%
So you're not going to get
the continuous improvement

12:33.110 --> 12:34.460 align:middle line:90%
process that you need.

12:34.460 --> 12:36.770 align:middle line:84%
And so you, as the
entrepreneur, you,

12:36.770 --> 12:40.280 align:middle line:84%
as the CEO of your company,
have to stay on top of it

12:40.280 --> 12:43.400 align:middle line:84%
because anything that falls
into that category of key

12:43.400 --> 12:46.190 align:middle line:84%
to your success,
you better know it.

12:46.190 --> 12:50.060 align:middle line:84%
You've got to know it, live it,

Every company I've ever started,
I've gone to a spreadsheet

12:59.300 --> 13:01.790 align:middle line:90%
and put in all my costs.

13:01.790 --> 13:04.850 align:middle line:84%
I've put in everything
from utilities

13:04.850 --> 13:08.600 align:middle line:84%

me-- everything and anything

that I can think of
would be a possible cost,

I have to look at the worst case

13:16.880 --> 13:19.160 align:middle line:84%

planning out your business,

13:19.160 --> 13:21.710 align:middle line:84%
you can't lie to
yourself because one

thing that every entrepreneur
does is lie to themselves.

13:26.250 --> 13:28.620 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yeah, I won't
have this expense.

13:28.620 --> 13:30.210 align:middle line:90%
No, you'll have that expense.

13:30.210 --> 13:32.130 align:middle line:84%

Your competition is
going to respond.

13:37.950 --> 13:40.770 align:middle line:84%
You have to plan for the worst
and look at the worst case

13:40.770 --> 13:43.512 align:middle line:84%
scenario, and if that worst
case scenario doesn't come,

13:43.512 --> 13:45.720 align:middle line:84%
well, that's just more money
for you, so you're fine.

13:45.720 --> 13:49.020 align:middle line:84%
But I always go through
and do the spreadsheets.

13:49.020 --> 13:52.470 align:middle line:84%
To this day, I go through
and do the spreadsheets.

13:52.470 --> 13:56.100 align:middle line:84%
What I've learned in
all these years is

13:56.100 --> 14:00.780 align:middle line:84%
once you have a base of
understanding technology

14:00.780 --> 14:04.860 align:middle line:84%
and business and the language of
business-- accounting, finance,

14:04.860 --> 14:07.230 align:middle line:84%
and marketing-- you
can start seeing how

14:07.230 --> 14:09.570 align:middle line:90%
all the pieces fit together.

14:09.570 --> 14:15.360 align:middle line:84%
And I think that really
is important for me

14:15.360 --> 14:19.770 align:middle line:84%
because I have the confidence
that I can learn whatever

15:11.000 --> 15:15.110 align:middle line:84%
After I graduated college,
and I didn't have a job,

15:15.110 --> 15:19.100 align:middle line:84%
I went and hooked
up with these guys

15:19.100 --> 15:21.380 align:middle line:90%
who were selling powdered milk.

15:21.380 --> 15:24.830 align:middle line:84%
And the whole concept
was milk is expensive,

15:24.830 --> 15:28.940 align:middle line:84%
and if you have this powder
that you can carry around,

15:28.940 --> 15:31.730 align:middle line:84%
you can just mix it up,
and it'd be cheaper,

15:31.730 --> 15:33.350 align:middle line:84%
and it'd be available
all the time.

15:33.350 --> 15:35.750 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't have to have
milk cartons, all that stuff.

15:35.750 --> 15:37.430 align:middle line:84%
It didn't taste quite
as good as milk,

15:37.430 --> 15:40.100 align:middle line:84%
but it was close, you know,
if you close your eyes.

15:40.100 --> 15:42.620 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought that would
be a great opportunity,

15:42.620 --> 15:46.580 align:middle line:84%
and I started selling powdered
milk, except I never sold one.

15:46.580 --> 15:50.150 align:middle line:84%
Anytime anybody would taste
it, they would be like, no.

15:50.150 --> 15:51.620 align:middle line:90%

I was what?

so as someone who's

15:56.043 --> 15:58.460 align:middle line:84%
failed many many, many, many,
many, many, many, many, many

15:58.460 --> 16:00.980 align:middle line:90%

company, you're probably

16:40.740 --> 16:42.240 align:middle line:90%
going to incorporate it.

16:42.240 --> 16:44.820 align:middle line:84%
And when you
incorporate a company,

16:44.820 --> 16:48.090 align:middle line:84%
initially, you just
typically put up $1,

16:48.090 --> 16:52.050 align:middle line:84%
and you own 100% of the
shares in that company.

16:52.050 --> 16:54.750 align:middle line:84%
If you don't raise
money from anybody else,

16:54.750 --> 16:58.500 align:middle line:84%
and you keep all those shares,
all the extra work that you're

16:58.500 --> 17:01.380 align:middle line:84%
doing because you didn't
bring in money that allows you

17:01.380 --> 17:03.450 align:middle line:84%
to hire somebody
or whatever, that's

17:03.450 --> 17:05.160 align:middle line:84%
called sweat
equity, where you're

17:05.160 --> 17:08.730 align:middle line:84%
putting your sweat to retain
equity rather than sell it

17:08.730 --> 17:09.810 align:middle line:90%
to somebody else.

17:09.810 --> 17:12.000 align:middle line:84%
Most companies don't think
it all the way through.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.190 align:middle line:84%
They just think, I got to
go out and raise money.

17:14.190 --> 17:15.240 align:middle line:90%
That's not the case.

17:15.240 --> 17:17.250 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
things that you can do,

17:17.250 --> 17:19.950 align:middle line:84%
and I'll say it over
and over and over again.

17:19.950 --> 17:21.720 align:middle line:84%
When you raise
money, particularly

17:21.720 --> 17:24.670 align:middle line:84%
as a young company, you
have to give up more equity.

17:24.670 --> 17:27.280 align:middle line:84%
You have to sell a bigger
percentage of your company

17:27.280 --> 17:28.540 align:middle line:90%
because you're young.

17:28.540 --> 17:31.240 align:middle line:84%
So what I try to tell
my entrepreneurs is,

17:31.240 --> 17:34.090 align:middle line:84%
raising money should
be your last resort

17:34.090 --> 17:37.270 align:middle line:84%
when that's the only way to
get where you want to go,

17:37.270 --> 17:40.720 align:middle line:84%
because when you raise money,
it's not an accomplishment.

17:40.720 --> 17:43.772 align:middle line:84%
So many companies-- oh, we
just raised this and that.

17:43.772 --> 17:44.980 align:middle line:90%
That's not an accomplishment.

17:44.980 --> 17:46.360 align:middle line:90%
That's an obligation.

17:46.360 --> 17:47.800 align:middle line:84%
The people who
gave you the money

17:47.800 --> 17:50.218 align:middle line:84%
didn't do it because
they like you, right?

17:50.218 --> 17:51.760 align:middle line:84%
They did it because
they want to make

17:51.760 --> 17:53.350 align:middle line:90%
a return on their investment.

17:53.350 --> 17:55.030 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell you
how many examples

17:55.030 --> 17:57.880 align:middle line:84%
I've seen, companies that
have sold for billions

17:57.880 --> 18:02.680 align:middle line:84%
of dollars, the founders or one
of the founders owned 1% or 2%.

18:02.680 --> 18:06.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, 1% or 2% of $1 billion
is still a lot of money,

18:06.550 --> 18:08.770 align:middle line:84%
but if they would not
have raised as much money

18:08.770 --> 18:12.025 align:middle line:84%
when they sold, they'd be
worth a whole lot more money.

18:12.025 --> 18:15.770 align:middle line:90%

18:17.240 --> 18:19.520 align:middle line:84%
The only reason
you know who I am

18:19.520 --> 18:22.310 align:middle line:84%
is because I have
billions of dollars.

18:22.310 --> 18:25.130 align:middle line:84%
And the only reason I
have billions of dollars

18:25.130 --> 18:29.327 align:middle line:84%
is because I did not immediately
go out and raise money.

18:29.327 --> 18:30.410 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you an example--

18:30.410 --> 18:31.452 align:middle line:90%
broadcast.com.

18:31.452 --> 18:33.410 align:middle line:84%
You know that feeling
you get in your stomach

18:33.410 --> 18:34.520 align:middle line:84%
when you want to know
what's the score,

18:34.520 --> 18:35.900 align:middle line:84%
and you want to hear
what's going on?

18:35.900 --> 18:37.108 align:middle line:90%
That's not a problem anymore.

18:37.108 --> 18:39.350 align:middle line:84%
You know, a little PC and
a connection to the net,

18:39.350 --> 18:41.660 align:middle line:84%
I might as well be sitting
in Bloomington, Indiana.

18:41.660 --> 18:43.490 align:middle line:84%
I was having
lunch with my buddy

18:43.490 --> 18:44.900 align:middle line:90%
from college, Todd Wagner.

18:44.900 --> 18:47.690 align:middle line:84%
And we were at a California
Pizza Kitchen in Dallas

18:47.690 --> 18:50.090 align:middle line:84%
just shooting the shit
like we would get together

18:50.090 --> 18:51.500 align:middle line:90%
from time to time and do.

18:51.500 --> 18:56.480 align:middle line:84%
And it was end of
1994, early 1995.

18:56.480 --> 18:58.160 align:middle line:84%
And it was like,
you know, there's

18:58.160 --> 18:59.630 align:middle line:84%
this new thing
called the internet,

18:59.630 --> 19:02.750 align:middle line:84%
and there's got to be a way
that we can listen to Indiana

19:02.750 --> 19:04.400 align:middle line:84%
University basketball,
where we went

19:04.400 --> 19:06.110 align:middle line:90%
to school, over the internet.

19:06.110 --> 19:09.620 align:middle line:84%
The ball is just
a fleeting moment.

19:09.620 --> 19:11.630 align:middle line:84%
And mind you, at
that point in time,

19:11.630 --> 19:13.910 align:middle line:84%
for us to listen
to an Indiana game,

19:13.910 --> 19:15.710 align:middle line:84%
we literally would go
to someone's office,

19:15.710 --> 19:19.410 align:middle line:84%
and they would set up a
speakerphone, and somebody

19:19.410 --> 19:21.900 align:middle line:84%
in Bloomington, Indiana would
have a speakerphone there,

19:21.900 --> 19:23.940 align:middle line:84%
and we would have a
6 or 12 pack of beer,

19:23.940 --> 19:26.940 align:middle line:84%
and they would put a radio
next to their speakerphone,

19:26.940 --> 19:29.550 align:middle line:84%
and we would listen on our
speakerphone to the game, which

19:29.550 --> 19:32.400 align:middle line:84%
was insane now when you
think about it, but literally

19:32.400 --> 19:33.090 align:middle line:90%
what we did.

19:33.090 --> 19:36.090 align:middle line:84%
If it was exciting for me
to listen to those games,

19:36.090 --> 19:38.220 align:middle line:84%
it was going to be exciting
to all Hoosiers fans

19:38.220 --> 19:41.880 align:middle line:84%
everywhere and obviously apply
to all sports fans everywhere.

19:41.880 --> 19:45.300 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have an
office at that point.

19:45.300 --> 19:48.480 align:middle line:84%
It was just me working out of
the second bedroom of my house

19:48.480 --> 19:50.280 align:middle line:90%
and figuring it all out.

19:50.280 --> 19:53.100 align:middle line:84%
And I just started reading,
reading, reading, learning,

19:53.100 --> 19:56.070 align:middle line:84%
learning, learning, trying
to kludge different things

19:56.070 --> 19:56.970 align:middle line:90%
together.

19:56.970 --> 19:58.950 align:middle line:84%
Back then, it was
hard to stream.

19:58.950 --> 20:01.320 align:middle line:84%
Now you just stream, and
nobody thinks twice about it.

20:01.320 --> 20:04.260 align:middle line:84%
But back then, you
had to have a PC.

20:04.260 --> 20:07.200 align:middle line:84%
You had to have at
least a 14.4 modem

20:07.200 --> 20:09.630 align:middle line:90%
but preferably 56k modem--

20:09.630 --> 20:11.280 align:middle line:90%
who remembers modems anymore?

20:11.280 --> 20:15.270 align:middle line:84%
And then you had to
download your ISP software

20:15.270 --> 20:18.090 align:middle line:84%
to connect to the internet,
your TCP/IP client

20:18.090 --> 20:20.970 align:middle line:84%
to make the software work,
a streaming client on top

20:20.970 --> 20:24.600 align:middle line:84%
of that, all this work to
be able to listen to Indiana

20:24.600 --> 20:26.190 align:middle line:90%
University basketball.

20:26.190 --> 20:28.920 align:middle line:84%
Then we had to convince people
to go through this process,

20:28.920 --> 20:30.150 align:middle line:90%
and that was the unknown.

20:30.150 --> 20:34.110 align:middle line:84%
Would people download all this
software, go to this website,

20:34.110 --> 20:36.480 align:middle line:90%
and want to listen to all this?

20:36.480 --> 20:39.210 align:middle line:84%
And so I went on
Compuserve bulletin

20:39.210 --> 20:43.500 align:middle line:84%
boards, Prodigy bulletin boards,
AOL chat rooms, you name it.

20:43.500 --> 20:46.230 align:middle line:84%
I went everywhere saying, hey,
if you live outside of Dallas,

20:46.230 --> 20:48.960 align:middle line:84%
and you're interested in
Dallas sports and Dallas news,

20:48.960 --> 20:50.400 align:middle line:90%
go to broadcast.com.

20:50.400 --> 20:53.420 align:middle line:84%
Follow the instructions,
yada, yada.

20:53.420 --> 20:59.330 align:middle line:84%
10 people first day, then
100, first month, 1,000,

20:59.330 --> 21:04.430 align:middle line:84%
then 10,000-- and then
it was like, oh, my god.

21:04.430 --> 21:06.560 align:middle line:90%
And I knew we had something.

21:06.560 --> 21:10.880 align:middle line:84%
And when you have a startup that
serves a need-- in this case,

21:10.880 --> 21:15.200 align:middle line:84%
allowing people to get access to
content they otherwise couldn't

21:15.200 --> 21:17.540 align:middle line:84%
get access to-- and
they're willing to change

21:17.540 --> 21:20.030 align:middle line:84%
their behavior in
order to do it,

21:20.030 --> 21:23.300 align:middle line:84%
that's when you know you've
got something that's clicking.

21:23.300 --> 21:26.120 align:middle line:84%
And Todd and I knew,
and it was like, okay,

21:26.120 --> 21:27.380 align:middle line:90%
we're off to the races.

21:27.380 --> 21:29.090 align:middle line:90%
We broadcast football games.

21:29.090 --> 21:30.830 align:middle line:90%
We broadcast basketball games.

21:30.830 --> 21:32.270 align:middle line:90%
My brother got married.

21:32.270 --> 21:35.060 align:middle line:84%
We streamed his wedding
on the internet.

21:35.060 --> 21:36.920 align:middle line:84%
Bowling-- everything
and anything

21:36.920 --> 21:40.490 align:middle line:84%
you can possibly imagine that we
legally were allowed to put up,

21:40.490 --> 21:42.060 align:middle line:90%
we put up on broadcast.com.

21:42.060 --> 21:45.290 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

21:45.290 --> 21:48.610 align:middle line:90%


21:48.610 --> 21:50.605 align:middle line:84%
Like with
broadcast.com, I wasn't

21:50.605 --> 21:53.230 align:middle line:84%
the only one who saw the pot of
gold at the end of the rainbow.

21:53.230 --> 21:56.740 align:middle line:84%
There were so many competitors
popping up left and right.

21:56.740 --> 22:00.190 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the things I
learned very specifically

22:00.190 --> 22:02.950 align:middle line:84%
is you have to learn how to
preempt your competition.

22:02.950 --> 22:05.800 align:middle line:84%
What are the things that you can
do to beat them to the punch?

22:05.800 --> 22:08.650 align:middle line:84%
We had to realize that while
other companies were raising

22:08.650 --> 22:11.770 align:middle line:84%
more money, it wasn't about
how much money we could raise.

22:11.770 --> 22:14.320 align:middle line:84%
It was about how much sales
that we could generate.

22:14.320 --> 22:17.800 align:middle line:84%
Sales cures all, but it's
profitable sales that matter.

22:17.800 --> 22:20.590 align:middle line:84%
And at broadcast.com, even
though the entire industry

22:20.590 --> 22:22.600 align:middle line:84%
said it doesn't matter
how much money you lose,

22:22.600 --> 22:25.840 align:middle line:84%
just go public, and
sell, sell, sell,

22:25.840 --> 22:27.790 align:middle line:84%
we were on a path
to profitability.

22:27.790 --> 22:29.350 align:middle line:90%
And so we were out there.

22:29.350 --> 22:33.040 align:middle line:84%
We-- out of 330 employees
that we had, 300 of them

22:33.040 --> 22:34.390 align:middle line:90%
were in sales and marketing.

22:34.390 --> 22:36.670 align:middle line:84%
We knew that without
sales, we were just

22:36.670 --> 22:39.280 align:middle line:84%
like every other startup that
was just out there grinding

22:39.280 --> 22:41.080 align:middle line:90%
away, so we really pushed.

22:41.080 --> 22:44.290 align:middle line:84%
And our mission wasn't to
just grow the top line.

22:44.290 --> 22:47.380 align:middle line:84%
Our mission was to be
profitable as soon as possible.

22:47.380 --> 22:50.770 align:middle line:84%
Business is the most
competitive sport.

22:50.770 --> 22:53.560 align:middle line:84%
You have to understand
your competition.

22:53.560 --> 22:57.070 align:middle line:84%
You have to know them as
well as they know themselves.

22:57.070 --> 23:00.520 align:middle line:84%

all day, every day.

23:00.520 --> 23:03.370 align:middle line:84%
Anytime I see their name
mentioned, I'm reading it.

23:03.370 --> 23:06.490 align:middle line:84%
If they're a public company, I'm
reading the quarterly earnings

23:06.490 --> 23:09.820 align:middle line:84%
transcripts, everything,
because the marginal cost

23:09.820 --> 23:13.780 align:middle line:84%
in time versus the marginal
value of an opportunity it

23:13.780 --> 23:15.373 align:middle line:90%
creates--

23:15.373 --> 23:16.915 align:middle line:84%

I'm going to do it.

23:20.380 --> 23:24.190 align:middle line:84%
otherworldly, some say, with
no basis in reality whatsoever.

23:24.190 --> 23:29.060 align:middle line:84%
Broadcast.com, up
87 points in a day.

23:29.060 --> 23:31.890 align:middle line:84%
We went public
in July of 1998--

23:31.890 --> 23:34.930 align:middle line:84%
biggest first day increase of
an IPO stock in the history

23:34.930 --> 23:35.980 align:middle line:90%
of the stock market.

23:35.980 --> 23:37.810 align:middle line:84%
So that got a lot of
people's attention.

23:37.810 --> 23:39.820 align:middle line:84%
And then a year later,
we used that money.

23:39.820 --> 23:42.910 align:middle line:84%
We just kept on growing, and
Yahoo came along and said,

23:42.910 --> 23:43.540 align:middle line:90%
you know what?

23:43.540 --> 23:46.570 align:middle line:84%
We need to add
multimedia to yahoo.com,

23:46.570 --> 23:48.400 align:middle line:84%
and you're a public
company, so we'll

23:48.400 --> 23:51.280 align:middle line:84%
pay you a premium over
the current stock price.

23:51.280 --> 23:57.670 align:middle line:84%
And that turned out to be
$5.7 billion in Yahoo stock.

23:57.670 --> 23:59.770 align:middle line:84%
What does it feel like
to know that you're

23:59.770 --> 24:02.750 align:middle line:90%
worth more than $1 billion?

24:02.750 --> 24:06.590 align:middle line:84%
So fucking good, I can
never possibly explain it.

24:06.590 --> 24:09.200 align:middle line:84%
You know, I think if I had
to start all over again,

24:09.200 --> 24:10.520 align:middle line:90%
could I make $1 million?

24:10.520 --> 24:11.060 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

24:11.060 --> 24:14.780 align:middle line:84%
But for me, to
make $1 billion, I

24:14.780 --> 24:16.550 align:middle line:84%
had to be friends
with the right person.

24:16.550 --> 24:19.280 align:middle line:84%
Then I had to start a company
that was in the technology

24:19.280 --> 24:22.910 align:middle line:84%
industry right when the stock
market for internet stocks

24:22.910 --> 24:24.650 align:middle line:90%
was just blowing up.

24:24.650 --> 24:27.410 align:middle line:84%
So all those things
had to happen for me

24:27.410 --> 24:28.670 align:middle line:90%
to become a billionaire.

24:28.670 --> 24:32.570 align:middle line:84%
And if you ask anybody who
has $1 billion or more,

24:32.570 --> 24:34.400 align:middle line:84%
and they tell you
they weren't lucky,

24:34.400 --> 24:36.065 align:middle line:90%
they're lying out their ass.

Not every idea is a good idea.

24:43.820 --> 24:45.410 align:middle line:90%
What makes it a good idea?

24:45.410 --> 24:48.290 align:middle line:84%
Having customers--
that's the ultimate test.

24:48.290 --> 24:50.993 align:middle line:84%
Is somebody going to
be willing to hire you?

24:50.993 --> 24:52.160 align:middle line:90%
Will they write you a check?

24:52.160 --> 24:53.368 align:middle line:90%
Will they send you the money?

24:53.368 --> 24:54.650 align:middle line:90%
That's the test.

24:54.650 --> 24:57.230 align:middle line:84%
And when I get an idea,
I look at the idea

24:57.230 --> 24:59.630 align:middle line:84%
and say, okay, does
that sound compelling,

24:59.630 --> 25:01.250 align:middle line:90%
differentiated to me?

25:01.250 --> 25:02.510 align:middle line:90%
Does that sound unique?

25:02.510 --> 25:04.790 align:middle line:84%
But I'm still not
sure, so what do I do?

25:04.790 --> 25:08.720 align:middle line:84%
I Google it, and I
read every single thing

25:08.720 --> 25:13.760 align:middle line:84%
that I possibly can about that
idea and every single thing

25:13.760 --> 25:16.310 align:middle line:84%
that I possibly can
about the companies that

25:16.310 --> 25:17.450 align:middle line:90%
are in that business.

25:17.450 --> 25:19.260 align:middle line:84%
I'll read their
financials, whatever it is.

25:19.260 --> 25:20.090 align:middle line:90%
I can find.

25:20.090 --> 25:24.680 align:middle line:84%
What I look for in an idea on
"Shark Tank," the thing that

25:24.680 --> 25:28.070 align:middle line:84%
gets me most excited is
when I sit there listening

25:28.070 --> 25:30.740 align:middle line:84%
to the pitch, and my
first thought is, damn,

25:30.740 --> 25:32.060 align:middle line:90%
why didn't I think of that?

25:32.060 --> 25:36.080 align:middle line:84%
Say hello to HiccAway,
the most effective way

25:36.080 --> 25:37.490 align:middle line:90%
that you can stop your hiccups.

25:37.490 --> 25:38.840 align:middle line:90%
What's the effectiveness rate?

90% effectiveness.

25:40.382 --> 25:42.720 align:middle line:84%
"Shark Tank" is exactly
what it appears to be.

25:42.720 --> 25:44.190 align:middle line:90%
Someone comes on the carpet.

25:44.190 --> 25:46.620 align:middle line:84%
We know nothing about them
when they walk in the door.

25:46.620 --> 25:49.950 align:middle line:84%
They spend their three minutes
pitching us whatever it may be,

25:49.950 --> 25:52.230 align:middle line:84%
and then we pepper
them with questions

25:52.230 --> 25:53.760 align:middle line:84%
to help us understand
whether or not

25:53.760 --> 25:55.890 align:middle line:84%
this is a good investment
or a bad investment.

25:55.890 --> 25:58.770 align:middle line:84%
And that, in turn, hopefully
helps the entrepreneur

25:58.770 --> 26:00.150 align:middle line:84%
and potentially
gets them a deal.

26:00.150 --> 26:01.860 align:middle line:84%
I guarantee you
this will become

26:01.860 --> 26:04.630 align:middle line:84%
part of everybody's medicine
cabinet, guaranteed, right?

26:04.630 --> 26:05.130 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

26:05.130 --> 26:07.005 align:middle line:84%
MARK CUBAN: So I'll make
you an offer, right,

26:07.005 --> 26:08.400 align:middle line:90%
and I just want a yes or no.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to tell you
a "Shark Tank" secret.

26:10.320 --> 26:14.700 align:middle line:84%
If you walk in and stand on
that carpet, and you say to us,

26:14.700 --> 26:21.300 align:middle line:84%
this is a $7.3 billion
market, and if I only

26:21.300 --> 26:25.380 align:middle line:84%
get 1% of that market,
I'll have $73 million

26:25.380 --> 26:29.130 align:middle line:84%
in sales or profits, it's
an immediate, I'm out.

26:29.130 --> 26:33.120 align:middle line:84%
Get out of here, right, because
everybody's going to say,

26:33.120 --> 26:34.770 align:middle line:84%
if I only get this
small percentage,

26:34.770 --> 26:38.100 align:middle line:84%
and it seems so easy
to get 1%, right?

26:38.100 --> 26:39.150 align:middle line:90%
Who can't get 1%?

26:39.150 --> 26:40.170 align:middle line:90%
But you can't.

26:40.170 --> 26:44.160 align:middle line:84%
And so I don't look at
total addressable market.

26:44.160 --> 26:47.160 align:middle line:84%
I don't look at
potential market share.

26:47.160 --> 26:50.430 align:middle line:84%
I look at it and say, can I
take this product and service

26:50.430 --> 26:52.740 align:middle line:84%
and sell the heck out
of it and make a profit

26:52.740 --> 26:55.050 align:middle line:84%
out of it, and what's it
going to take for me to do it,

26:55.050 --> 26:58.680 align:middle line:84%
and is that worth my time
and worth the economics?

26:58.680 --> 27:00.660 align:middle line:90%
Mark, you have a deal.

27:00.660 --> 27:01.410 align:middle line:90%
You have a deal.

Well done.

There's going to be
times when people

27:05.010 --> 27:06.960 align:middle line:84%
walk on the carpet with
the best intentions,

27:06.960 --> 27:08.880 align:middle line:84%
and they're excited
about their business,

27:08.880 --> 27:11.130 align:middle line:84%
and they'll give you
all kinds of numbers,

27:11.130 --> 27:13.830 align:middle line:84%
and they'll give you, you know,
why they think it's important

27:13.830 --> 27:15.480 align:middle line:84%
and why they think
it's exciting.

27:15.480 --> 27:18.208 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is
fart candles are not

27:18.208 --> 27:19.875 align:middle line:84%

[MUSIC PLAYING]

28:07.280 --> 28:09.030 align:middle line:84%
WHITNEY GATES: Crafting
the elevator pitch

28:09.030 --> 28:11.280 align:middle line:84%
was actually
incredibly difficult

28:11.280 --> 28:14.430 align:middle line:84%
because we wanted to make
sure that we were delivering

28:14.430 --> 28:18.780 align:middle line:84%
the entertainment for TV, but
we were informing the sharks

28:18.780 --> 28:22.590 align:middle line:84%
on what our business was and
why it filled a unique need

28:22.590 --> 28:24.780 align:middle line:84%
or unique niche
within the industry.

28:24.780 --> 28:26.850 align:middle line:84%
And honestly, the
most successful pitches

28:26.850 --> 28:28.890 align:middle line:84%
are those that
surprises and delights

28:28.890 --> 28:32.670 align:middle line:84%
the listener, where you
reveal to them that, oh, man,

28:32.670 --> 28:34.100 align:middle line:84%
I never really
knew I needed this.

28:34.100 --> 28:35.850 align:middle line:84%
WHITNEY GATES: We call
that infotainment--

28:35.850 --> 28:36.480 align:middle line:90%
CHAZ GATES: Infotainment, yeah.

28:36.480 --> 28:37.730 align:middle line:90%
 --in the marketing industry.

28:37.730 --> 28:41.220 align:middle line:84%
And so you leave the
listener feeling like, man, I

28:41.220 --> 28:44.010 align:middle line:84%
need to go to the store to
buy this now without having

28:44.010 --> 28:44.880 align:middle line:90%
to tell them that.

28:44.880 --> 28:49.320 align:middle line:84%
Not everybody is going to
be great at making a pitch

28:49.320 --> 28:51.720 align:middle line:84%
when there's a bunch
of TV cameras on you,

28:51.720 --> 28:55.020 align:middle line:84%
and there's five sharks getting
ready to ask you questions.

28:55.020 --> 28:57.090 align:middle line:84%
You can practice all you
want, but that's hard.

28:57.090 --> 28:59.400 align:middle line:84%
So what stood out
about Chaz and Whitney

28:59.400 --> 29:04.020 align:middle line:84%
was everything they said
was relative to growing

29:04.020 --> 29:04.740 align:middle line:90%
the business.

29:04.740 --> 29:07.020 align:middle line:84%
We're winemakers, and
so with the investment,

29:07.020 --> 29:08.670 align:middle line:84%
we would invest
that into equipment

29:08.670 --> 29:10.410 align:middle line:84%
so an automatic
bottling line, which

29:10.410 --> 29:12.780 align:middle line:84%
would help us be more
efficient and the winemaking--

29:12.780 --> 29:13.980 align:middle line:84%
MARK CUBAN: So you own
all your own equipment,

29:13.980 --> 29:15.450 align:middle line:84%
and you do all
your own bottling?

29:15.450 --> 29:16.575 align:middle line:90%
CHAZ GATES: All of it, yes.

29:16.575 --> 29:17.790 align:middle line:90%
They were doing the work.

29:17.790 --> 29:20.520 align:middle line:84%
You know, they were
bottling it, and they

29:20.520 --> 29:23.040 align:middle line:84%
wanted a machine to improve
the process of bottling.

29:23.040 --> 29:26.400 align:middle line:84%
They were taking the
wines to retailers

29:26.400 --> 29:30.000 align:middle line:84%
and selling them themselves
instead of hiring a distributor

29:30.000 --> 29:31.290 align:middle line:90%
to do all that for them.

29:31.290 --> 29:32.790 align:middle line:90%
I thought, you know what?

29:32.790 --> 29:36.240 align:middle line:84%
They're a husband and wife
team, and with just a little bit

29:36.240 --> 29:39.077 align:middle line:84%
of support, I can help
them continue to grow.

29:39.077 --> 29:41.160 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean they're
going to be a $100 million

29:41.160 --> 29:46.320 align:middle line:84%
company tomorrow, but we could
go from $100,000 in sales

29:46.320 --> 29:50.252 align:middle line:84%
to $500,000 to $1 million
to 2 to $5 million

29:50.252 --> 29:52.710 align:middle line:84%
and take it from there, and
that's exactly what's happened.

29:52.710 --> 29:56.456 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

29:56.456 --> 29:57.920 align:middle line:90%


29:57.920 --> 30:00.830 align:middle line:84%
Every entrepreneur
wants to grow.

30:00.830 --> 30:04.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's a big difference
between growing profitably

30:04.010 --> 30:05.870 align:middle line:84%
and growth for the
sake of growth.

30:05.870 --> 30:08.630 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's where a lot
of entrepreneurs get confused.

30:08.630 --> 30:11.360 align:middle line:84%
So your startup
entrepreneur-- typically,

30:11.360 --> 30:14.690 align:middle line:84%
it's probably just you, maybe
one or two other people.

30:14.690 --> 30:18.080 align:middle line:84%
You should prioritize
not spending money.

30:18.080 --> 30:22.010 align:middle line:84%
You should do everything
possible not to spend money.

30:22.010 --> 30:26.090 align:middle line:84%
And you should focus
everything you can

30:26.090 --> 30:29.120 align:middle line:84%
on, how can I improve
my sales and my profit

30:29.120 --> 30:30.680 align:middle line:90%
margins, my gross margins?

30:30.680 --> 30:32.600 align:middle line:84%
And that growth
mindset is, how can I

30:32.600 --> 30:35.240 align:middle line:84%
increase my sales with
high gross margins, which

30:35.240 --> 30:36.800 align:middle line:90%
then increases my profits?

30:36.800 --> 30:40.680 align:middle line:84%
And how can I think about
that every single day?

30:40.680 --> 30:41.960 align:middle line:90%
We make our wine ourselves.

30:41.960 --> 30:43.010 align:middle line:90%
100%.

30:43.010 --> 30:44.540 align:middle line:90%
It's a dirty job.

30:44.540 --> 30:46.580 align:middle line:84%
We're in the winery,
and it's exhausting.

to become more automated

30:52.580 --> 30:54.710 align:middle line:84%
in our approach
to producing wine,

30:54.710 --> 30:59.520 align:middle line:84%
and so we had seen a number
of unique automated bottling

30:59.520 --> 31:00.020 align:middle line:90%
lines.

31:00.020 --> 31:02.962 align:middle line:84%

we've got these options.

And Mark goes, lease something
old from one of those companies

31:14.840 --> 31:15.950 align:middle line:90%
that you saw.

Instead of getting
their newest innovation,

31:18.500 --> 31:22.670 align:middle line:84%
find something older that gets
the job done just as well that

great piece of advice

MARK CUBAN: You know,
margins, as a startup,

31:35.810 --> 31:37.700 align:middle line:84%
really depend on your
product or service.

31:37.700 --> 31:39.890 align:middle line:84%
If you're a service-driven
company where

31:39.890 --> 31:42.800 align:middle line:84%
you're the product and you're
doing work for somebody,

31:42.800 --> 31:46.400 align:middle line:84%
you want your margins
to be 80%, 90%, 95%

31:46.400 --> 31:49.250 align:middle line:84%
because effectively, you're
paying yourself, right?

31:49.250 --> 31:51.410 align:middle line:84%
And to grow that
company, you're going

31:51.410 --> 31:53.120 align:middle line:90%
to have to hire individuals.

31:53.120 --> 31:55.430 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have to
pay for their expertise.

31:55.430 --> 31:58.100 align:middle line:84%
For product-driven
companies, it really

31:58.100 --> 32:00.050 align:middle line:84%
depends on the product
that you're selling

32:00.050 --> 32:01.550 align:middle line:84%
and the market
you're selling to.

32:01.550 --> 32:04.820 align:middle line:84%
If you're high
volume, low margin,

32:04.820 --> 32:07.160 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have to make
sure you know your numbers.

32:07.160 --> 32:08.540 align:middle line:90%
So I'll give you an example.

32:08.540 --> 32:12.560 align:middle line:84%
There are companies that sell
consumer products companies

32:12.560 --> 32:15.020 align:middle line:90%
into big box retailers.

32:15.020 --> 32:16.850 align:middle line:90%
It might be a chocolate bar.

32:16.850 --> 32:19.490 align:middle line:90%
It might be, you know, soap.

32:19.490 --> 32:21.140 align:middle line:90%
It might be sponges.

32:21.140 --> 32:24.710 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is, because you're
putting it on a retail shelf,

32:24.710 --> 32:26.270 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
have to understand

32:26.270 --> 32:28.310 align:middle line:90%
how the demand is driven.

32:28.310 --> 32:32.030 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes demand is going
to be driven by advertising

32:32.030 --> 32:33.390 align:middle line:90%
in their circulars.

32:33.390 --> 32:36.390 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes your demand is going
to be driven by placement.

32:36.390 --> 32:39.490 align:middle line:84%
And they know where the most
valuable spots in their store

32:39.490 --> 32:39.990 align:middle line:90%
are.

32:39.990 --> 32:42.960 align:middle line:84%
You know, are you at the
checkout counter, right?

32:42.960 --> 32:44.155 align:middle line:90%
Are you on an end cap?

32:44.155 --> 32:45.780 align:middle line:84%
So you're right on
the end of an aisle.

32:45.780 --> 32:48.220 align:middle line:84%
Are you at eye level, or
are you at the bottom?

32:48.220 --> 32:51.030 align:middle line:84%
And they know those are the
valuable spots in their store,

32:51.030 --> 32:53.730 align:middle line:84%
and so they charge you
a premium to be there.

32:53.730 --> 32:57.210 align:middle line:84%
That is the equivalent of a
marketing or advertising fee,

32:57.210 --> 33:00.330 align:middle line:84%
but you have to build that
into your cost of goods

33:00.330 --> 33:02.550 align:middle line:84%
so that it becomes
part of your margin.

33:02.550 --> 33:06.046 align:middle line:90%

33:06.046 --> 33:06.950 align:middle line:90%


33:06.950 --> 33:09.860 align:middle line:84%
I had a company that
we just invested--

33:09.860 --> 33:11.030 align:middle line:90%
we are about to invest in.

33:11.030 --> 33:12.500 align:middle line:90%
We're doing due diligence.

33:12.500 --> 33:16.070 align:middle line:84%
And we asked them about
those special fees,

33:16.070 --> 33:17.515 align:middle line:90%
end cap fees, et cetera.

33:17.515 --> 33:18.890 align:middle line:84%
They said, well,
we don't include

33:18.890 --> 33:20.060 align:middle line:90%
those in cost of goods sold.

33:20.060 --> 33:22.850 align:middle line:84%
And we're like, well, then
your margins are wrong.

33:22.850 --> 33:26.420 align:middle line:84%
You don't have the 40% margins
you're telling us you have.

33:26.420 --> 33:29.540 align:middle line:84%
You actually have 3%
margins because you're

33:29.540 --> 33:35.420 align:middle line:84%
spending 37% on all these
in-store promotions and things

33:35.420 --> 33:36.740 align:middle line:90%
that you have to do.

33:36.740 --> 33:39.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
you're losing money

33:39.410 --> 33:42.350 align:middle line:84%
because you're not able to
drive demand without doing

33:42.350 --> 33:43.550 align:middle line:90%
in-store promotion.

33:43.550 --> 33:45.830 align:middle line:84%
And so when it
comes to margin, you

33:45.830 --> 33:49.430 align:middle line:84%
have to know specifically
what your demand drivers are

33:49.430 --> 33:52.640 align:middle line:84%
and account for all those when
you're pricing your product.

33:52.640 --> 33:55.400 align:middle line:84%
Wondry Wines-- they
have to understand

33:55.400 --> 33:57.170 align:middle line:84%
that they're in a
stairstep business,

33:57.170 --> 34:01.940 align:middle line:84%
meaning that once they get
to a certain level of sales,

34:01.940 --> 34:04.940 align:middle line:84%
they need more production
equipment to allow

34:04.940 --> 34:06.140 align:middle line:90%
them to grow more.

34:06.140 --> 34:09.239 align:middle line:84%
So not only do they need
to have enough margins

34:09.239 --> 34:13.260 align:middle line:84%
to pay for their cost of goods
sold, to pay for the wine,

34:13.260 --> 34:16.679 align:middle line:84%
to pay for employees,
to pay for facilities,

34:16.679 --> 34:19.980 align:middle line:84%
but they need to anticipate
that they have to put money

34:19.980 --> 34:24.000 align:middle line:84%
in the bank to be able to afford
a step up in their production

34:24.000 --> 34:24.780 align:middle line:90%
equipment.

34:24.780 --> 34:28.170 align:middle line:84%
Mark's advice has always been
to not do too much too soon,

34:28.170 --> 34:31.530 align:middle line:84%
and what he means by that is if
you have a good, solid product

34:31.530 --> 34:34.409 align:middle line:84%
that resonate with
consumers, over time,

34:34.409 --> 34:37.860 align:middle line:84%
it is going to grow and
skyrocket organically.

34:37.860 --> 34:39.989 align:middle line:84%
You know, we use the term,
"business life coach,"

34:39.989 --> 34:45.330 align:middle line:84%
because working with Mark as
a mentor, sometimes his advice

34:45.330 --> 34:47.235 align:middle line:84%
is very different
than what we expect.

34:47.235 --> 34:48.000 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

34:48.000 --> 34:51.210 align:middle line:84%
Even sometimes, we're just
saying-- sending him an update,

34:51.210 --> 34:53.520 align:middle line:84%
just saying, hey,
here are our numbers.

34:53.520 --> 34:56.250 align:middle line:84%
We're expanding
here, and you know,

34:56.250 --> 34:58.170 align:middle line:84%
we want him to be--
he's happy for it,

34:58.170 --> 35:00.630 align:middle line:84%
but then he's that
voice of reason

35:00.630 --> 35:03.360 align:middle line:84%
or that kind of parent,
who steps in and says, hey,

35:03.360 --> 35:07.580 align:middle line:84%
growth is great, but what are
your velocities off shelf?

35:07.580 --> 35:09.830 align:middle line:84%
You know, you're expanding
to these new markets,

35:09.830 --> 35:13.490 align:middle line:84%
but we also have to make sure
that your in-store purchases

35:13.490 --> 35:15.770 align:middle line:84%
are healthy and that
they're growing.

35:15.770 --> 35:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And so yes, sometimes,
we go in, and we

35:19.400 --> 35:21.380 align:middle line:84%
think we're
expecting one answer,

35:21.380 --> 35:25.400 align:middle line:84%
but then he gives us
this-- this truth syrup.

35:25.400 --> 35:27.440 align:middle line:90%
And it's exactly what you need.

35:27.440 --> 35:28.940 align:middle line:84%
You may not want
it in the moment,

35:28.940 --> 35:31.400 align:middle line:84%
but, you know, a few
months down the line,

35:31.400 --> 35:33.545 align:middle line:84%
you realize man, that,
advice was spot on.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

35:36.602 --> 35:38.920 align:middle line:90%


35:38.920 --> 35:42.280 align:middle line:84%
You can drown an opportunity,
where companies think,

35:42.280 --> 35:43.690 align:middle line:90%
okay, I've got this product.

35:43.690 --> 35:44.560 align:middle line:90%
Let me add another.

35:44.560 --> 35:46.750 align:middle line:84%
And let me tell you
why companies do that.

35:46.750 --> 35:48.790 align:middle line:84%
You get started as
an entrepreneur,

35:48.790 --> 35:50.950 align:middle line:84%
and you come up with a good
idea, and it's selling.

35:50.950 --> 35:52.930 align:middle line:84%
You think, oh, I'm good
at coming up with ideas

35:52.930 --> 35:53.860 align:middle line:90%
and selling things.

35:53.860 --> 35:57.250 align:middle line:84%
And when that product,
that first product kind of

35:57.250 --> 36:00.430 align:middle line:84%
hits a slowdown,
and you realize it's

36:00.430 --> 36:02.800 align:middle line:84%
going to be hard to
find a way to accelerate

36:02.800 --> 36:05.140 align:middle line:84%
those sales again,
we tend to go and try

36:05.140 --> 36:06.550 align:middle line:90%
to find another product.

36:06.550 --> 36:08.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
entrepreneurs always do,

36:08.830 --> 36:10.750 align:middle line:84%
and it's almost
always a mistake.

36:10.750 --> 36:14.590 align:middle line:84%
Too often, entrepreneurs
try to rush the process.

36:14.590 --> 36:16.480 align:middle line:90%
They try to grow too fast.

36:16.480 --> 36:18.910 align:middle line:84%
They think, well, I
got to be to a million

36:18.910 --> 36:21.130 align:middle line:84%
or $5 million or $10
million in sales fast.

36:21.130 --> 36:23.830 align:middle line:84%
No, you got to stay in
business, and you've

36:23.830 --> 36:26.470 align:middle line:84%
got to generate margin
dollars that pay your bills.

36:26.470 --> 36:29.110 align:middle line:84%
And so it's not just
about how big I am.

36:29.110 --> 36:31.210 align:middle line:90%
It's about, am I profitable?

36:31.210 --> 36:32.830 align:middle line:90%
Can I stay in business?

36:32.830 --> 36:35.170 align:middle line:84%
And am I running this
company in a manner

36:35.170 --> 36:37.790 align:middle line:84%
that allows me to stay in
business, should something

36:37.790 --> 36:38.330 align:middle line:90%
go wrong?

36:42.950 --> 36:44.810 align:middle line:84%
Shortly after going
on "Shark Tank,"

36:44.810 --> 36:46.520 align:middle line:90%
we sold out of everything.

36:46.520 --> 36:50.330 align:middle line:84%
We sold out on shelf,
we sold out online,

36:50.330 --> 36:53.940 align:middle line:84%
and we faced a
really critical point

36:53.940 --> 36:58.130 align:middle line:84%
because it takes time to
produce and bottle wine.

36:58.130 --> 37:00.500 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the
first pieces of advice

37:00.500 --> 37:03.770 align:middle line:84%
we went to for Mark
was, what do we do?

37:03.770 --> 37:05.420 align:middle line:90%
And, you know, he--

37:05.420 --> 37:07.670 align:middle line:84%
the first thing he told us
was, well, your consumers--

37:07.670 --> 37:09.080 align:middle line:90%
they want to hear from you.

37:09.080 --> 37:11.270 align:middle line:84%
Create a video where you
can speak to your consumers

37:11.270 --> 37:13.010 align:middle line:84%
directly, and be
honest with them

37:13.010 --> 37:16.130 align:middle line:84%
about the experience of
why there may be delays.

37:16.130 --> 37:18.650 align:middle line:84%
No business is going
to go perfectly.

37:18.650 --> 37:20.870 align:middle line:90%
No business is a straight line.

37:20.870 --> 37:24.500 align:middle line:84%
So any entrepreneur that
runs into an issue trying

37:24.500 --> 37:26.750 align:middle line:84%
to hide-- the cover-up is
always worse than the crime,

37:26.750 --> 37:31.910 align:middle line:84%
right, even in small business
because when your customer

37:31.910 --> 37:35.630 align:middle line:84%
finds out that it wasn't quite
the way you explained it,

37:35.630 --> 37:37.880 align:middle line:90%
trust declines.

37:37.880 --> 37:41.210 align:middle line:84%
And let me just tell you,
in this day and age, when

37:41.210 --> 37:45.050 align:middle line:84%
we talk about misinformation,
the number one product

37:45.050 --> 37:48.230 align:middle line:84%

every single company

37:48.230 --> 37:51.350 align:middle line:84%

it is you're actually selling,

37:51.350 --> 37:51.935 align:middle line:90%
is trust.

of his stake in the
Dallas Mavericks.

38:26.020 --> 38:27.610 align:middle line:84%
And under the
terms of this deal,

38:27.610 --> 38:30.190 align:middle line:84%
Cuban will still maintain
full control of the team's

percentage of the Mavs

And so yeah.

38:37.210 --> 38:39.490 align:middle line:84%
I've learned a lot
from running the Mavs.

38:39.490 --> 38:42.490 align:middle line:84%
One, I learned that running
a professional sports

38:42.490 --> 38:46.270 align:middle line:84%
team, like the Dallas
Mavericks, is completely

38:46.270 --> 38:51.400 align:middle line:84%
unlike any other business or
industry anywhere in the world.

38:51.400 --> 38:53.530 align:middle line:84%
The sports-- you're just
in a different place

38:53.530 --> 38:54.910 align:middle line:90%
in people's hearts.

39:11.980 --> 39:14.740 align:middle line:84%
really well during the

the whole city is on fire.

39:16.270 --> 39:19.900 align:middle line:84%
When you go to a Mavs game,
when you walk in the door,

39:19.900 --> 39:21.220 align:middle line:90%
you feel the energy.

39:21.220 --> 39:22.660 align:middle line:90%
You feel the excitement.

close game, there's

39:25.120 --> 39:28.450 align:middle line:84%
that moment where
the whole crowd

39:28.450 --> 39:30.790 align:middle line:84%
is standing up cheering,
"Defense," or, "Let's go,

39:30.790 --> 39:31.720 align:middle line:90%
Mavs."

39:31.720 --> 39:34.810 align:middle line:84%
And what I've learned
from it is that it

39:34.810 --> 39:39.880 align:middle line:84%
is possible to create an
emotional connection to people,

39:43.900 --> 39:45.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's how you
create communities,

39:45.700 --> 39:48.340 align:middle line:84%
and communities
support each other.

39:48.340 --> 39:49.780 align:middle line:84%
And when they
support each other,

39:49.780 --> 39:52.990 align:middle line:84%
they recommend to each
other how to use the company

39:52.990 --> 39:55.960 align:middle line:84%
or how to support the company
or how to help the company.

39:55.960 --> 39:59.620 align:middle line:84%

find ways to do business

39:59.620 --> 40:02.305 align:middle line:84%

40:06.580 --> 40:11.030 align:middle line:84%
Every single game is a
ball of stress for me

40:11.030 --> 40:12.710 align:middle line:90%
because I want to win that bad.

40:12.710 --> 40:15.650 align:middle line:84%
When I first bought the
team, after we lost a game,

40:15.650 --> 40:18.230 align:middle line:84%
it would take me
two days to recover.

40:18.230 --> 40:21.605 align:middle line:84%
And now, you know, I just
stress eat if we lose.

40:21.605 --> 40:24.806 align:middle line:90%

40:24.806 --> 40:27.240 align:middle line:90%


40:27.240 --> 40:29.970 align:middle line:84%
I get asked all the time if
there's a specific sector

40:29.970 --> 40:34.110 align:middle line:84%
or area or business
that's ripe for innovation

40:34.110 --> 40:36.758 align:middle line:84%
or ripe for disruption or
ripe for starting a business.

40:36.758 --> 40:38.550 align:middle line:84%
That's not the way I
look at things at all.

40:38.550 --> 40:39.750 align:middle line:90%
I love to learn.

40:39.750 --> 40:41.580 align:middle line:84%
I always try to
expand my horizons,

40:41.580 --> 40:43.770 align:middle line:84%
and as I experience
things, I tend

40:43.770 --> 40:45.990 align:middle line:84%
to walk into any business,
any circumstance,

40:45.990 --> 40:48.180 align:middle line:84%
and say, okay, how
would I change this?

40:48.180 --> 40:49.320 align:middle line:90%
What could I do better?

40:49.320 --> 40:50.910 align:middle line:90%
How would I reinvent this?

40:50.910 --> 40:53.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's what gets
me excited, and that's

40:53.640 --> 40:55.170 align:middle line:90%
how I approach things.

40:55.170 --> 40:57.840 align:middle line:84%
I was a season ticket holder
for the Dallas Mavericks.

40:57.840 --> 41:01.230 align:middle line:84%
I went to opening night,
and it's not a sellout.

41:01.230 --> 41:03.090 align:middle line:84%
There's no energy
in the building.

41:03.090 --> 41:06.810 align:middle line:84%
I was sitting there and going,
I can do a better job than this.

41:06.810 --> 41:08.070 align:middle line:90%
And then I realized it.

41:08.070 --> 41:11.850 align:middle line:84%
I could afford to buy the
Dallas Mavericks, and I did.

41:11.850 --> 41:13.890 align:middle line:84%
And I approached it
completely differently

41:13.890 --> 41:16.073 align:middle line:84%
than every other
owner in the NBA did.

41:16.073 --> 41:18.240 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I was so different,
they used to yell at me

41:18.240 --> 41:19.020 align:middle line:90%
and scream at me.

41:19.020 --> 41:20.970 align:middle line:84%
Like, when I first
got to the Mavericks,

41:20.970 --> 41:24.630 align:middle line:84%
we spent more money
on software training

41:24.630 --> 41:27.400 align:middle line:84%
than we did on
player development.

41:27.400 --> 41:30.880 align:middle line:84%
In any business, you're only
as good as your employees.

41:30.880 --> 41:35.230 align:middle line:84%
And so I brought in
probably 15 former Mavericks

41:35.230 --> 41:37.990 align:middle line:84%
who were looking for ways
to get back into the NBA

41:37.990 --> 41:39.130 align:middle line:90%
after their playing days.

41:39.130 --> 41:43.450 align:middle line:84%
I just said, I want you to come
in and be development coaches.

41:43.450 --> 41:45.760 align:middle line:90%
And you'll be on our roster.

41:45.760 --> 41:49.030 align:middle line:84%
We'll show you in the program
that you are a development

41:49.030 --> 41:51.010 align:middle line:90%
coach for the Dallas Mavericks.

41:51.010 --> 41:54.730 align:middle line:90%
The whole league went nuts.

41:54.730 --> 41:57.430 align:middle line:84%
We finished out the season
I bought them, like,

41:57.430 --> 41:59.920 align:middle line:84%
23 and 9, and the
next year, we went on

41:59.920 --> 42:02.950 align:middle line:84%
to have 50 win seasons
in the next 10 years.

42:02.950 --> 42:05.260 align:middle line:84%
And so people realized,
you know, maybe

42:05.260 --> 42:06.490 align:middle line:90%
we're doing something right.

42:06.490 --> 42:12.070 align:middle line:84%
And now every team has got
10 development coaches.

42:12.070 --> 42:14.950 align:middle line:84%
But the point is I didn't
go looking by sector,

42:14.950 --> 42:16.810 align:middle line:84%
and I never have,
and I never will.

42:16.810 --> 42:19.643 align:middle line:84%
What I do is, based
off of my experiences,

42:19.643 --> 42:22.060 align:middle line:84%
when I walk into a room, when
I walk into a business, when

42:22.060 --> 42:24.190 align:middle line:84%
I read about something,
I always ask myself,

42:24.190 --> 42:25.480 align:middle line:90%
could I do a better job?

42:25.480 --> 42:28.480 align:middle line:84%
And if I think I can, and I'm
willing to put my money where

42:28.480 --> 42:30.850 align:middle line:90%
my mouth is, I go for it.

42:30.850 --> 42:33.390 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

42:33.390 --> 42:36.690 align:middle line:84%
When I first bought the team,
it became really clear to me

42:36.690 --> 42:39.660 align:middle line:84%
as a customer that they thought
their product was basketball.

42:39.660 --> 42:43.080 align:middle line:84%
And it really-- and this is
a lesson I learned then that

42:43.080 --> 42:44.370 align:middle line:90%
I've kept--

42:44.370 --> 42:46.590 align:middle line:84%
you know, tried to apply
to all my businesses.

42:46.590 --> 42:48.420 align:middle line:84%
You have to know what
business you're in.

42:48.420 --> 42:51.630 align:middle line:84%
The NBA is not in the
business of basketball.

42:51.630 --> 42:54.420 align:middle line:84%
We are in the business
of experiences.

42:54.420 --> 42:56.700 align:middle line:84%
You go to the games
not to watch a game.

42:56.700 --> 42:58.080 align:middle line:90%
You can do that at home.

42:58.080 --> 43:00.360 align:middle line:84%
You go to the games to
get a unique experience,

43:00.360 --> 43:04.290 align:middle line:84%
to feel that energy, to yell,
to scream, to let it out.

43:04.290 --> 43:06.930 align:middle line:84%
We have to be the answer to,
what do you want to do tonight?

43:06.930 --> 43:08.730 align:middle line:84%
And we want to be the
first thought that

43:08.730 --> 43:09.750 align:middle line:90%
comes to your mind.

43:09.750 --> 43:11.490 align:middle line:84%
Can we get tickets
to the Mavs game?

43:11.490 --> 43:12.660 align:middle line:84%
Because you can go
to McDonald's, you

43:12.660 --> 43:14.580 align:middle line:84%
can go out to dinner,
you can go to a movie,

43:14.580 --> 43:17.190 align:middle line:84%
you can go to the park,
you can go to a concert--

43:17.190 --> 43:19.970 align:middle line:84%
there's 1,000 different
things that you can do.

43:19.970 --> 43:22.470 align:middle line:84%
We want to be the answer to,
what do you want to do tonight?

[MUSIC PLAYING]

43:25.700 --> 43:30.020 align:middle line:84%
When I bought the Mavs, I didn't
put myself in a CEO's office.

43:30.020 --> 43:33.530 align:middle line:84%
I put my desk right in the
middle of all the salespeople

43:33.530 --> 43:35.270 align:middle line:84%
and picked up the
phone and started

43:35.270 --> 43:37.940 align:middle line:84%
calling previous customers
and telling them why

43:37.940 --> 43:39.320 align:middle line:90%
they should buy Mavs tickets.

43:39.320 --> 43:44.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm a huge fan of direct
sales because you-- having

43:44.960 --> 43:49.550 align:middle line:84%
a person reach out to somebody
and create a connection,

43:49.550 --> 43:52.310 align:middle line:90%
it educates you in so many ways.

43:52.310 --> 43:56.450 align:middle line:84%
It tells you what
that prospect feels

43:56.450 --> 43:58.490 align:middle line:90%
about your product or service.

43:58.490 --> 44:01.130 align:middle line:84%
It tells you what they
feel about the pricing,

44:01.130 --> 44:06.770 align:middle line:84%
and because you can figure out
who your most valid prospect is

44:06.770 --> 44:09.260 align:middle line:84%
going to be, you
know who to talk to.

44:09.260 --> 44:13.730 align:middle line:84%
And when you do that, you
are going to get a stronger

44:13.730 --> 44:15.620 align:middle line:90%
connection to your customer.

44:15.620 --> 44:17.660 align:middle line:84%
So my preference is,
wherever possible,

44:17.660 --> 44:19.160 align:middle line:90%
to use a direct sales force.

44:19.160 --> 44:22.370 align:middle line:84%
Ticket sales are important to
the Mavericks for two reasons--

44:22.370 --> 44:24.200 align:middle line:84%
one, the revenue,
obviously, you want

44:24.200 --> 44:26.783 align:middle line:84%
to be able to have because
the payrolls are high,

44:26.783 --> 44:28.950 align:middle line:84%
and you've got to be able
to support those payrolls.

44:28.950 --> 44:31.770 align:middle line:84%
But more importantly
is the value

44:31.770 --> 44:34.980 align:middle line:84%
of butts in the seats because
the more people in the arena,

44:34.980 --> 44:36.240 align:middle line:90%
the greater the energy.

44:36.240 --> 44:38.220 align:middle line:84%
The greater the
energy, the more people

44:38.220 --> 44:40.980 align:middle line:84%
chanting, "Defense, defense,"
or, "Let's go, Mavs."

44:40.980 --> 44:43.380 align:middle line:84%
The more energy that's in
the arena, the more people

44:43.380 --> 44:44.970 align:middle line:84%
want to come play
for the Mavericks.

44:44.970 --> 44:48.000 align:middle line:84%
So there's this
symbiotic relationship

44:48.000 --> 44:50.760 align:middle line:84%
between just the ticket
sale and performance

44:50.760 --> 44:52.650 align:middle line:84%
on the court, which
is why I've never

44:52.650 --> 44:55.230 align:middle line:84%
priced our tickets
to optimize revenue.

44:55.230 --> 44:59.072 align:middle line:84%
I've always priced our
tickets to optimize the number

44:59.072 --> 45:00.030 align:middle line:90%
of people in the arena.

45:00.030 --> 45:02.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're the fifth largest
or sixth largest market,

45:02.790 --> 45:06.930 align:middle line:84%
and our average ticket price
is down in the bottom 10.

45:06.930 --> 45:11.010 align:middle line:84%
Up until I think last year,
we had cheaper tickets

45:11.010 --> 45:13.590 align:middle line:90%
than the NFL team had parking.

45:13.590 --> 45:15.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, look, I
could run the team

45:15.870 --> 45:19.800 align:middle line:84%
to make money and
make money, but I

45:19.800 --> 45:22.612 align:middle line:84%
don't think I'd put us in
the best position to win.

45:22.612 --> 45:23.820 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I care about.

45:23.820 --> 45:25.028 align:middle line:90%
That's why I bought the team.

45:25.028 --> 45:28.000 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

45:28.000 --> 45:28.880 align:middle line:90%


45:28.880 --> 45:31.070 align:middle line:84%
When I first bought
the team, I wasn't

45:31.070 --> 45:33.560 align:middle line:84%
trying to make the most
amount of money off the Mavs,

45:33.560 --> 45:37.850 align:middle line:84%
so I let the business side of
it just pretty much run itself.

45:37.850 --> 45:43.730 align:middle line:84%
And we had a situation where the
CEO had done some things that

45:43.730 --> 45:46.973 align:middle line:84%
shouldn't have been done and
allowed some behavior that

45:46.973 --> 45:48.140 align:middle line:90%
shouldn't have been allowed.

45:48.140 --> 45:52.490 align:middle line:84%
I was absentee, and things
didn't go in the direction

45:52.490 --> 45:53.540 align:middle line:90%
that they should have.

45:53.540 --> 45:56.870 align:middle line:84%
And so I had to do a full
scale replacement from top

45:56.870 --> 45:58.730 align:middle line:90%
to bottom of management.

45:58.730 --> 46:00.410 align:middle line:90%
And that's exactly what we did.

46:00.410 --> 46:02.900 align:middle line:84%
We brought in Cynt
Marshall to revitalize

46:02.900 --> 46:05.000 align:middle line:90%
the culture and the operations.

46:05.000 --> 46:10.090 align:middle line:84%
And if you look now at what
the company looks like,

46:10.090 --> 46:13.310 align:middle line:84%
we reflect the community
a lot more than we did,

46:13.310 --> 46:17.810 align:middle line:84%
and we have procedures
in place that protect us

46:17.810 --> 46:19.430 align:middle line:90%
against this happening again.

46:19.430 --> 46:22.640 align:middle line:84%
I want the companies I
invest in and the people

46:22.640 --> 46:25.790 align:middle line:84%
I hire to represent
my customer base

46:25.790 --> 46:30.170 align:middle line:84%
and to reflect my customer
base, whether it's gender,

46:30.170 --> 46:34.310 align:middle line:84%
whether it is sexual
orientation, whether it's race.

46:34.310 --> 46:36.410 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it may
be, there's going

46:36.410 --> 46:39.200 align:middle line:84%
to be things that
I'm not going to be

46:39.200 --> 46:42.710 align:middle line:84%
able to understand or
connect to that somebody who

46:42.710 --> 46:44.390 align:middle line:90%
is part of a community can.

46:44.390 --> 46:47.780 align:middle line:84%
And I think that makes
it easier to sell.

46:47.780 --> 46:50.060 align:middle line:84%
That makes it easier to
make a customer happy.

46:50.060 --> 46:52.220 align:middle line:84%
That makes it easier
to connect to them.

46:52.220 --> 46:54.680 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
just good business.

Finding the right person for key
positions in a company is hard.

47:03.230 --> 47:06.167 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you're a company
of 5, 10, 15 people,

47:06.167 --> 47:08.000 align:middle line:84%
chances are you're
hiring somebody you know,

47:08.000 --> 47:10.310 align:middle line:84%
and that's a good thing
because trust is just

47:10.310 --> 47:13.190 align:middle line:84%
as important as knowledge
because the economics

47:13.190 --> 47:15.170 align:middle line:84%
and your finances are
always up in the air

47:15.170 --> 47:16.250 align:middle line:90%
when you're that small.

47:16.250 --> 47:22.730 align:middle line:84%
But as you get to 50 or 100 or
200 or more people, hire slow.

47:22.730 --> 47:26.060 align:middle line:84%
Take your time to
find the right fit.

47:26.060 --> 47:29.750 align:middle line:84%
Make sure that that person is
interviewed not just by you,

47:29.750 --> 47:32.030 align:middle line:84%
not just by a human
resources person,

47:32.030 --> 47:38.030 align:middle line:84%
but the people that they may be
managing or may be managed by.

47:38.030 --> 47:39.260 align:middle line:90%
And take your time.

47:39.260 --> 47:41.840 align:middle line:84%
And if that person doesn't
work for whatever reason,

47:41.840 --> 47:46.430 align:middle line:84%
cut them fast too because
holding on to somebody

47:46.430 --> 47:49.790 align:middle line:84%
when they shouldn't be there
is one of the great mistakes

small companies make.

47:51.500 --> 47:55.640 align:middle line:84%
And let me just tell you,
I hate firing people.

47:55.640 --> 47:57.420 align:middle line:84%
Let me just tell
you something else.

47:57.420 --> 48:00.690 align:middle line:90%
I am awful at hiring people.

48:00.690 --> 48:04.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm the world's worst
because I'm a sales person.

48:04.620 --> 48:07.680 align:middle line:84%
And I learned that when I
sit in front of somebody,

48:07.680 --> 48:10.230 align:middle line:84%
I sell myself on
why I should hire

48:10.230 --> 48:14.880 align:middle line:84%
them as opposed to figuring out
the right reasons to hire them.

48:14.880 --> 48:17.790 align:middle line:84%
So I learned early on to have
other people in the company

48:17.790 --> 48:21.000 align:middle line:84%
do the actual hiring, and
then doing the firing,

48:21.000 --> 48:23.430 align:middle line:84%
typically the CEO has
got to be that person.

48:23.430 --> 48:25.023 align:middle line:84%
But it's the most
painful thing ever,

[MUSIC PLAYING]

48:29.316 --> 48:30.260 align:middle line:90%


48:30.260 --> 48:33.140 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, I'm horrible at
interviewing and hiring people,

48:33.140 --> 48:35.690 align:middle line:84%
so I try to get our folks
who are much better at it

48:35.690 --> 48:36.410 align:middle line:90%
than I am.

48:36.410 --> 48:42.380 align:middle line:84%
But when I do do it, kind
of my drill questions

48:42.380 --> 48:45.140 align:middle line:84%
are not the "tell me about
yourself" or why you like,

48:45.140 --> 48:47.840 align:middle line:84%
you know, but what's
one thing you've

48:47.840 --> 48:51.020 align:middle line:84%
failed at, because I want to
know if they've taken chances.

48:51.020 --> 48:53.570 align:middle line:84%
What's one thing
you've succeeded at?

48:53.570 --> 48:56.090 align:middle line:84%
I do want to know why they
left their last job, if they--

48:56.090 --> 48:57.920 align:middle line:84%
if they're leaving
a previous job.

48:57.920 --> 49:00.680 align:middle line:84%
I want to know what's the
best culture of a company

49:00.680 --> 49:02.060 align:middle line:90%
that you've ever worked in.

49:02.060 --> 49:05.330 align:middle line:84%
Who's the best manager
you've ever worked for?

49:05.330 --> 49:08.060 align:middle line:84%
I want to get them talking
about their positive or negative

49:08.060 --> 49:10.877 align:middle line:84%
experiences, so I can
understand whether or not

49:10.877 --> 49:11.960 align:middle line:90%
they're going to be a fit.

49:11.960 --> 49:14.900 align:middle line:84%
And that leads me to another
very important point.

49:14.900 --> 49:18.470 align:middle line:90%
There are no home run hires.

49:18.470 --> 49:23.150 align:middle line:84%
Probably the biggest mistake I
see my portfolio companies make

49:23.150 --> 49:27.117 align:middle line:84%
is something's not going
as well as they want it to.

49:27.117 --> 49:29.450 align:middle line:84%
Sales aren't where they should
be, or, more importantly,

49:29.450 --> 49:31.860 align:middle line:84%
margin dollars are not
where they should be.

49:31.860 --> 49:34.620 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a
sudden, I get the email.

49:34.620 --> 49:39.990 align:middle line:84%
We just hired this fantastic,
incredible, amazing, stupendous

49:39.990 --> 49:42.870 align:middle line:84%
person to be our new
director of marketing,

49:42.870 --> 49:46.770 align:middle line:84%
our new director of sales, our
new head of revenue generation,

49:46.770 --> 49:48.910 align:middle line:90%
whatever you want to call it.

49:48.910 --> 49:50.800 align:middle line:90%
And they get so excited.

49:50.800 --> 49:54.850 align:middle line:84%
And I just drop my head and
say, oh, fuck, here we go again.

49:54.850 --> 49:57.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm not gonna say that you
can't hire the right person,

49:57.360 --> 49:59.860 align:middle line:84%
and that person won't-- there
won't be a person who can come

49:59.860 --> 50:00.940 align:middle line:90%
in and help you.

50:00.940 --> 50:04.360 align:middle line:84%
But if you find yourself
hiring and hiring and hiring

50:04.360 --> 50:06.550 align:middle line:84%
and always looking for
silver bullet hires,

50:06.550 --> 50:07.930 align:middle line:84%
you're in deep
trouble because it

50:07.930 --> 50:10.720 align:middle line:84%
means you're not willing to do
the work yourself to figure out

50:10.720 --> 50:12.642 align:middle line:90%
what the underlying problem is.

50:12.642 --> 50:14.350 align:middle line:84%
There's two things
that matter the most--

50:14.350 --> 50:16.000 align:middle line:90%
culture and competency.

50:16.000 --> 50:18.040 align:middle line:84%
Are they competent
enough to do the job,

50:18.040 --> 50:20.470 align:middle line:84%
and do they fit in the
culture of the organization?

50:20.470 --> 50:25.710 align:middle line:84%
If they fail on either one,
you're going to be in trouble.

50:25.710 --> 50:30.760 align:middle line:84%
You want to hire people that
complement your skill set.

50:30.760 --> 50:33.010 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the biggest
problems entrepreneurs

50:33.010 --> 50:38.215 align:middle line:84%
like the CEO can make is they
hire people who are like them.

50:38.215 --> 50:39.840 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to
hire people like you.

50:39.840 --> 50:41.370 align:middle line:90%
You got you, right?

50:41.370 --> 50:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And I've always tried
to partner with people

50:43.230 --> 50:44.820 align:middle line:90%
who complement my skills.

50:44.820 --> 50:46.650 align:middle line:84%
I don't need people
to tell me yes.

50:46.650 --> 50:49.590 align:middle line:84%
I can tell myself yes as
a CEO, as an entrepreneur.

50:49.590 --> 50:52.380 align:middle line:84%
I need people who are going to
challenge conventional wisdom

50:52.380 --> 50:54.420 align:middle line:84%
and challenge me,
and when they think

50:54.420 --> 50:57.000 align:middle line:84%
I've done something
wrong, say, I think--

50:57.000 --> 50:59.670 align:middle line:84%
I think you're making a
mistake here, and this is why.

50:59.670 --> 51:02.790 align:middle line:84%
You know, I get that with
Alex at Cost Plus Drugs.

51:02.790 --> 51:05.250 align:middle line:84%
I get that with Cynt at
the Dallas Mavericks,

51:05.250 --> 51:07.110 align:middle line:84%
and I look for that
in all my companies.

[CHANTING] We

51:15.230 --> 51:18.740 align:middle line:84%
MARK CUBAN: Back in 2017,
when the Republicans started

51:18.740 --> 51:21.530 align:middle line:84%
talking about wanting
to repeal the ACA,

51:21.530 --> 51:23.942 align:middle line:84%
I talked with some
Republicans in Dallas,

51:23.942 --> 51:26.150 align:middle line:84%
and they had no idea what
they would replace it with.

51:26.150 --> 51:28.400 align:middle line:84%
So I started thinking about
things that can happen

51:28.400 --> 51:30.020 align:middle line:84%
and putting together
some programs,

51:30.020 --> 51:32.000 align:middle line:84%
but it got me into
health care, and it

51:32.000 --> 51:34.790 align:middle line:84%
got me being a health
care geek, right,

51:34.790 --> 51:39.020 align:middle line:84%
reading up as much as I could
about how Medicare works,

51:39.020 --> 51:42.210 align:middle line:84%
how the ACA works, what Medpack
is, all-- how they determine

51:42.210 --> 51:43.460 align:middle line:90%
rates, all this kind of stuff.

51:43.460 --> 51:45.380 align:middle line:84%
And so-- and I kind
of liked it, right?

51:45.380 --> 51:47.090 align:middle line:84%
It was interesting
to me, and obviously,

51:47.090 --> 51:49.132 align:middle line:84%
when you think about health
care in this country,

51:49.132 --> 51:51.830 align:middle line:84%
whether it was
2017, 2018, or now,

51:51.830 --> 51:54.140 align:middle line:84%
people don't think,
well, it's great, right?

51:54.140 --> 51:56.930 align:middle line:84%
When people-- and again, going
back to the word, "trust."

51:56.930 --> 51:58.820 align:middle line:84%
You trust your
doctor, hopefully,

51:58.820 --> 52:01.910 align:middle line:84%
but you trust nothing else
in the whole health care

52:01.910 --> 52:02.810 align:middle line:90%
ecosystem.

52:02.810 --> 52:05.030 align:middle line:84%
You don't think you're
going to be charged fairly.

52:05.030 --> 52:06.613 align:middle line:84%
You don't trust your
insurance company

52:06.613 --> 52:09.740 align:middle line:84%
to even pay if you have
something that comes up.

52:09.740 --> 52:13.010 align:middle line:84%
Just there is
absolutely no trust.

52:13.010 --> 52:17.810 align:middle line:84%
And so in 2018, I got a
cold email from a Dr. Alex

52:17.810 --> 52:22.520 align:middle line:84%
Oshmyansky, and he was
starting a compounding pharmacy

52:22.520 --> 52:28.550 align:middle line:84%
in Denver, Colorado, to be able
to make generic drugs that were

52:28.550 --> 52:30.680 align:middle line:90%
in short supply or overpriced.

52:30.680 --> 52:35.510 align:middle line:84%
And as he educated me
on the generics industry

52:35.510 --> 52:37.300 align:middle line:84%
and the pharmaceutical
industry, I

52:37.300 --> 52:39.050 align:middle line:84%
realized this could
be a much bigger idea.

52:39.050 --> 52:39.675 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

52:39.675 --> 52:42.470 align:middle line:84%
I pushed him in the direction
of saying, you know,

52:42.470 --> 52:44.540 align:middle line:84%
let's create this
company, call it

52:44.540 --> 52:47.960 align:middle line:84%
Cost Plus Drugs, where we're
completely transparent.

52:47.960 --> 52:51.200 align:middle line:84%
We show you what our
cost is, and we show you

52:51.200 --> 52:53.330 align:middle line:90%
what our markup is, 15%.

52:53.330 --> 52:56.150 align:middle line:84%
If you went on there and
put in "amoxicillin,"

52:56.150 --> 53:00.800 align:middle line:84%
you would see that our
cost for 30 units was $3,

53:00.800 --> 53:05.840 align:middle line:84%
and we marked it up 15%,
so your price was $3.45.

53:05.840 --> 53:09.230 align:middle line:84%
And as it's turned
out, that price

53:09.230 --> 53:12.590 align:middle line:84%
is cheaper than pretty much
anywhere else you can get it.

53:12.590 --> 53:16.440 align:middle line:84%
The fact that, in 2023, in
the United States of America,

53:16.440 --> 53:20.670 align:middle line:84%
people are choosing between
rent, daycare, food,

53:20.670 --> 53:23.760 align:middle line:84%
and their medications
is just insane.

53:23.760 --> 53:26.520 align:middle line:84%
And so our mission
is to change that.

53:32.370 --> 53:34.500 align:middle line:84%
There's really two reasons
to start a business--

53:34.500 --> 53:35.670 align:middle line:84%
I think I'm going
to make some money,

53:35.670 --> 53:38.212 align:middle line:84%
I think I've got a product, I
think, or service that'll work,

53:38.212 --> 53:40.380 align:middle line:90%
or I just love the mission.

53:40.380 --> 53:42.930 align:middle line:84%
And the mission is more
important than the business.

53:42.930 --> 53:46.290 align:middle line:84%
And you have to decide which
one of those fits you the best.

53:46.290 --> 53:49.500 align:middle line:84%
With a mission, the challenge
is, can you make any money off

53:49.500 --> 53:51.432 align:middle line:84%
of it, because if it's
just important to you,

53:51.432 --> 53:52.890 align:middle line:84%
and you're trying
to save the world

53:52.890 --> 53:55.830 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it is you're
trying to have an impact on,

53:55.830 --> 53:57.510 align:middle line:90%
it has to be self-sustaining.

53:57.510 --> 53:58.950 align:middle line:84%
You can't create
a business that's

53:58.950 --> 54:01.500 align:middle line:84%
just going to suck money
just because you're

54:01.500 --> 54:02.400 align:middle line:90%
passionate about it.

54:02.400 --> 54:03.840 align:middle line:90%
They call those charities.

54:03.840 --> 54:06.900 align:middle line:84%
With Cost Plus Drugs, when Alex
and I looked at co-founding it,

54:06.900 --> 54:09.835 align:middle line:84%
it was half
mission-driven, where

54:09.835 --> 54:12.210 align:middle line:84%
we're going to fuck up the
pharmaceutical industry-- this

54:12.210 --> 54:15.210 align:middle line:84%
is going to be so much fun,
I can't stand it-- and half,

54:15.210 --> 54:16.980 align:middle line:84%
do I think I'll
make money on this?

54:16.980 --> 54:18.600 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

54:18.600 --> 54:21.510 align:middle line:84%
You know, when you change
an industry like this,

54:21.510 --> 54:26.000 align:middle line:84%
even if you're just making
pennies on every dollar,

54:26.000 --> 54:27.910 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of
dollars involved.

54:27.910 --> 54:30.410 align:middle line:84%
But we also had to figure out,
can we make the business work

54:30.410 --> 54:32.030 align:middle line:90%
at a 15% margin?

54:32.030 --> 54:35.540 align:middle line:84%
And to do that, we have
to be low, low cost.

54:35.540 --> 54:39.160 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

54:39.160 --> 54:41.290 align:middle line:84%
That means we can't
do all the things

54:41.290 --> 54:44.950 align:middle line:84%
that other people we compete
with might be able to do.

54:44.950 --> 54:48.220 align:middle line:84%
Our customer service is going to
be slower than other companies,

54:48.220 --> 54:49.630 align:middle line:90%
and that leads to complaints.

54:49.630 --> 54:52.210 align:middle line:84%
And we had to make
the conscious decision

54:52.210 --> 54:56.830 align:middle line:84%
that in the tradeoff between
spending more money on customer

54:56.830 --> 55:00.370 align:middle line:84%
service reps or increasing
the price of the medications

55:00.370 --> 55:03.210 align:middle line:84%
to cover all that,
we decided we're

55:03.210 --> 55:06.010 align:middle line:84%
going to give up something
in customer service

55:06.010 --> 55:08.290 align:middle line:84%
but keep the lower
cost because someone

55:08.290 --> 55:11.110 align:middle line:84%
not being able to afford
their medications is

55:11.110 --> 55:13.600 align:middle line:84%
more impactful than
having them delayed.

55:13.600 --> 55:19.150 align:middle line:84%
We launched it on January 19th
of 2022, and all of a sudden,

55:19.150 --> 55:20.980 align:middle line:90%
it just, oof--

55:20.980 --> 55:24.520 align:middle line:84%
you know, to say, you
know, it grew 10 times

55:24.520 --> 55:28.030 align:middle line:84%
faster than we ever expected
is an understatement.

55:28.030 --> 55:30.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, our site was
costplusdrugs.com,

55:30.940 --> 55:33.130 align:middle line:84%
and it was crashing,
and we couldn't keep up

55:33.130 --> 55:35.650 align:middle line:84%
with the demand
and this and that.

55:35.650 --> 55:40.180 align:middle line:84%
But it just proved the point
that transparency and trust

55:40.180 --> 55:44.020 align:middle line:84%
is absolutely needed in
the health care industry.

55:44.020 --> 55:47.800 align:middle line:84%
The whole industry can
be fixed, but the problem

55:47.800 --> 55:50.910 align:middle line:90%
is we need to simplify it.

55:50.910 --> 55:53.580 align:middle line:84%
And I tell our folks at
Cost Plus, since day one,

55:53.580 --> 55:58.230 align:middle line:84%
we buy drugs, we sell drugs, but
our biggest product is trust.

55:58.230 --> 56:00.810 align:middle line:84%
And that was one
of the key reasons

56:00.810 --> 56:02.220 align:middle line:90%
why I put my name on it--

56:02.220 --> 56:04.290 align:middle line:84%
I've never put my name
on a company before--

56:04.290 --> 56:06.390 align:middle line:84%
because I wanted
people to realize

56:06.390 --> 56:07.740 align:middle line:90%
that I'm all in on this.

56:07.740 --> 56:08.760 align:middle line:84%
You know, I have
this saying, when

56:08.760 --> 56:11.218 align:middle line:84%
you run with the elephants,
there's the quick and the dead.

56:11.218 --> 56:15.000 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to be
agile and move quickly

56:15.000 --> 56:17.520 align:middle line:84%
in order to be able to
compete against the big guys.

56:17.520 --> 56:20.290 align:middle line:84%
And right now, we're
the mice, right,

56:20.290 --> 56:21.540 align:middle line:90%
running against the elephants.

56:21.540 --> 56:23.220 align:middle line:84%
So they're not--
they think about us,

56:23.220 --> 56:25.512 align:middle line:84%
and they ask about us because
they know we're a threat,

56:25.512 --> 56:27.480 align:middle line:84%
but they're not
concerned about us yet.

56:27.480 --> 56:30.930 align:middle line:84%
But we think that by
working outside the system,

56:30.930 --> 56:33.978 align:middle line:84%
we can be transparent,
which they can't be.

56:33.978 --> 56:35.520 align:middle line:84%
You know, so when
you look at Amazon,

56:35.520 --> 56:37.645 align:middle line:84%
Amazon is never going to
show you their true costs.

56:37.645 --> 56:39.840 align:middle line:84%
You look at GoodRX,
they're not showing you

56:39.840 --> 56:40.950 align:middle line:90%
their true-- true cost.

56:40.950 --> 56:42.690 align:middle line:84%
We're the only company
that does that.

56:42.690 --> 56:46.470 align:middle line:84%
And in anticipating what those
companies might do, you know,

56:46.470 --> 56:48.150 align:middle line:90%
we're Cost Plus 15%.

56:48.150 --> 56:50.370 align:middle line:90%
Could they do Cost Plus 1%?

56:50.370 --> 56:52.620 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they could, and we'll
just have to deal with it.

56:52.620 --> 56:56.650 align:middle line:84%
You know, so if someone comes
along and says, Cost Plus 15%

56:56.650 --> 56:57.820 align:middle line:90%
is way too much.

56:57.820 --> 57:00.820 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be
Cost Plus 1%, then

57:00.820 --> 57:03.460 align:middle line:84%
we'll fall back on what we know
to be our core product, which

57:03.460 --> 57:04.180 align:middle line:90%
is trust.

57:04.180 --> 57:06.550 align:middle line:84%
But more importantly,
we can look back

57:06.550 --> 57:10.630 align:middle line:84%
and say, okay, step by step
by step, Mark Cuban Cost Plus

57:10.630 --> 57:14.395 align:middle line:84%
Drugs dismantled the health
care industry for the better.

57:17.584 --> 57:20.980 align:middle line:90%


57:20.980 --> 57:24.730 align:middle line:84%
In an era of social media,
people make connections

57:24.730 --> 57:26.410 align:middle line:90%
differently than they used to.

57:26.410 --> 57:29.350 align:middle line:84%
And our connections
are we follow people.

57:29.350 --> 57:33.790 align:middle line:84%
We have common interests, but
we experience those interests

57:33.790 --> 57:34.810 align:middle line:90%
online.

57:34.810 --> 57:38.350 align:middle line:84%
And in doing so, we become
part of a larger community.

57:38.350 --> 57:42.430 align:middle line:84%
And when you connect to
people on a personal level,

57:42.430 --> 57:43.840 align:middle line:90%
good things happen.

57:43.840 --> 57:44.470 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my gosh.

57:44.470 --> 57:46.330 align:middle line:90%
Mark absolutely loves ideas.

57:46.330 --> 57:48.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's-- that's what
connected us to begin with when

57:48.970 --> 57:49.990 align:middle line:90%
we first met.

57:49.990 --> 57:52.630 align:middle line:84%
I just remember him
and I diving straight

57:52.630 --> 57:55.870 align:middle line:84%
into talking about a bunch
of different business ideas.

57:55.870 --> 57:57.790 align:middle line:84%
MARK CUBAN: I met Falon
at South by Southwest,

57:57.790 --> 57:59.380 align:middle line:90%
and she was sharp.

57:59.380 --> 58:01.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, she's just super smart,
the youngest employee ever

58:01.930 --> 58:04.000 align:middle line:90%
at Google and at YouTube.

58:04.000 --> 58:08.350 align:middle line:84%
Falon caught my attention with
her skills and her intelligence

58:08.350 --> 58:09.520 align:middle line:90%
and her drive.

58:09.520 --> 58:11.740 align:middle line:84%
She not only checked
all the boxes,

58:11.740 --> 58:13.270 align:middle line:90%
but she knew what she was doing.

58:13.270 --> 58:14.770 align:middle line:90%
She's good at what she does.

58:14.770 --> 58:17.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Mark Cuban has so
many achievements in business--

58:17.590 --> 58:21.440 align:middle line:84%
obviously, broadcast.com, which
was the company that made him

58:21.440 --> 58:23.690 align:middle line:84%
a billionaire, where he put
streaming on the internet.

58:23.690 --> 58:27.632 align:middle line:84%
And as I was sharing the ideas
I had with him about Fireside,

58:27.632 --> 58:29.090 align:middle line:84%
I was like, oh, my
god, like, we're

58:29.090 --> 58:31.580 align:middle line:84%
basically building the next
generation of all of that.

58:31.580 --> 58:35.750 align:middle line:84%
And so it made sense for
us to build it together.

58:35.750 --> 58:39.380 align:middle line:84%
What we do at
Fireside is partner

58:39.380 --> 58:42.590 align:middle line:84%
with revenue-generating
media franchises,

58:42.590 --> 58:44.930 align:middle line:84%
IP owners, and brands
that are already

58:44.930 --> 58:49.040 align:middle line:84%
connecting with their
consumers in a direct way.

58:49.040 --> 58:51.950 align:middle line:84%
And we enable them to
take those relationships

58:51.950 --> 58:53.330 align:middle line:90%
to the next level.

58:53.330 --> 58:56.690 align:middle line:84%
And we do that through
interactive experiences

58:56.690 --> 59:00.680 align:middle line:84%
that we power through our
industry-first interactive

59:00.680 --> 59:02.210 align:middle line:90%
streaming technology.

59:02.210 --> 59:05.150 align:middle line:84%
Imagine you can now cook along
with Michelin starred chefs

59:05.150 --> 59:08.420 align:middle line:84%
and actually turn on your
camera and join the stage

59:08.420 --> 59:10.220 align:middle line:90%
and show your end product.

59:10.220 --> 59:12.290 align:middle line:84%
Fireside is not a
social media platform.

59:12.290 --> 59:15.200 align:middle line:84%
Very complementary to
the communities that

59:15.200 --> 59:17.180 align:middle line:84%
might start on
social media, you can

59:17.180 --> 59:20.180 align:middle line:84%
interact on platforms
like Twitch or TikTok.

59:20.180 --> 59:23.390 align:middle line:84%
Here, it's all about
creating intimate connections

59:23.390 --> 59:25.730 align:middle line:84%
between them and
their communities.

59:25.730 --> 59:27.380 align:middle line:90%
One great example of that--

59:27.380 --> 59:32.330 align:middle line:84%
Matchbox 20 was one of
the first artists that was

59:32.330 --> 59:34.910 align:middle line:90%
on broadcast.com 23 years ago.

59:34.910 --> 59:37.970 align:middle line:84%
23 years later,
Matchbox 20 is one

59:37.970 --> 59:40.610 align:middle line:84%
of the first artists
that is also launching

59:40.610 --> 59:42.590 align:middle line:90%
a network powered by Fireside.

59:42.590 --> 59:45.350 align:middle line:84%
What they're creating is an
interactive fan experience.

59:45.350 --> 59:47.690 align:middle line:84%
Rob or Kyle or Paul,
one of the band members,

59:47.690 --> 59:50.427 align:middle line:84%
they're going to be essentially
on stage, so it's as if, like,

59:50.427 --> 59:52.760 align:middle line:84%
you're-- you're literally
talking to-- talk to them from

59:52.760 --> 59:53.677 align:middle line:90%
the palm of your hand.

59:53.677 --> 59:56.750 align:middle line:84%
You can watch them on the TV
and be able to react to them.

59:56.750 --> 59:57.440 align:middle line:90%
You can laugh.

59:57.440 --> 59:58.190 align:middle line:90%
You can clap.

59:58.190 --> 59:59.450 align:middle line:90%
You can ask a question.

59:59.450 --> 01:00:02.105 align:middle line:84%
You can request to speak and get
invited to turn on your camera

01:00:02.105 --> 01:00:03.980 align:middle line:84%
and actually join
the virtual stage

01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:07.400 align:middle line:84%
and be able to now have
this super fan experience.

01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:12.620 align:middle line:84%
And so it ends up just creating
almost a level of intimacy

01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:16.370 align:middle line:84%
that is so powerful, and
really, it's an industry first.

01:00:16.370 --> 01:00:19.460 align:middle line:84%
Mark's been very involved
in the early shaping

01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:22.790 align:middle line:84%
of not just the product,
the technology, but also

01:00:22.790 --> 01:00:25.430 align:middle line:84%
of the overall go-to-market
strategy and marketing plan.

01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:26.990 align:middle line:84%
Like, the laughing
and the clapping

01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:27.948 align:middle line:90%
and the sound effects--

01:00:27.948 --> 01:00:29.870 align:middle line:84%
I attribute a lot of
that to his ideas.

01:00:29.870 --> 01:00:32.960 align:middle line:90%
And I love that problem solving.

01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:34.640 align:middle line:90%
I love that critical thinking.

01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:36.590 align:middle line:84%
And I love doing that
with a great team.

01:00:36.590 --> 01:00:39.610 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:00:39.610 --> 01:00:41.820 align:middle line:84%
One thing that companies
tend to do these days

01:00:41.820 --> 01:00:44.610 align:middle line:84%
is they they start,
but they don't really

01:00:44.610 --> 01:00:46.680 align:middle line:84%
know how they're going
to get to profitability.

01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:50.190 align:middle line:84%
And that applies even more
so with content companies

01:00:50.190 --> 01:00:53.040 align:middle line:84%
because with content
companies, it's often something

01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:56.790 align:middle line:84%
that the creator is passionate
about or has fun with,

01:00:56.790 --> 01:01:01.260 align:middle line:84%
and they-- they see the
value of getting a following

01:01:01.260 --> 01:01:04.680 align:middle line:84%
on a social media platform,
but they never really

01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:07.980 align:middle line:84%
think about how much work it is
relative to the compensation.

01:01:07.980 --> 01:01:10.500 align:middle line:84%
Typically, on social media,
you might have followers,

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:11.780 align:middle line:90%
but that's all you know.

01:01:11.780 --> 01:01:13.530 align:middle line:84%
You don't really know
anything about them.

01:01:13.530 --> 01:01:16.770 align:middle line:84%
With Fireside, they
solve that problem

01:01:16.770 --> 01:01:19.410 align:middle line:84%
because they allow you
to register your users.

01:01:19.410 --> 01:01:22.380 align:middle line:84%
You own the users, unlike
other platforms, where

01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:23.730 align:middle line:90%
they're the platform's user.

01:01:23.730 --> 01:01:25.140 align:middle line:90%
This is your network.

01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:26.010 align:middle line:90%
You control it.

01:01:26.010 --> 01:01:27.840 align:middle line:90%
You control the upsells.

01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:29.700 align:middle line:90%
You control the charges.

01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:31.085 align:middle line:90%
You control the finances.

01:01:31.085 --> 01:01:33.210 align:middle line:84%
The content that you put
on third party platforms

01:01:33.210 --> 01:01:35.610 align:middle line:84%
like social is not
necessarily owned

01:01:35.610 --> 01:01:38.160 align:middle line:84%
by you, the owner
of that content,

01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:41.410 align:middle line:84%
because those platforms are
going to take that high quality

01:01:41.410 --> 01:01:44.290 align:middle line:84%
content, and they're going to
use it to fundamentally benefit

01:01:44.290 --> 01:01:46.810 align:middle line:84%
their needs, which is
to show someone an ad.

01:01:46.810 --> 01:01:51.790 align:middle line:84%
What Fireside enables you to do
is to take control of your IP,

01:01:51.790 --> 01:01:54.880 align:middle line:84%
take control of your
ownership of your community,

01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:59.020 align:middle line:84%
and really be able to
do it all on your terms.

01:01:59.020 --> 01:02:00.940 align:middle line:84%
When we started the
streaming industry

01:02:00.940 --> 01:02:04.330 align:middle line:84%
way back when, there were
technological challenges,

01:02:04.330 --> 01:02:07.060 align:middle line:84%
but one of the greatest
challenges then, as in now,

01:02:07.060 --> 01:02:08.320 align:middle line:90%
is monetization.

01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:10.060 align:middle line:84%
It's one thing to
get an audience.

01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:12.190 align:middle line:84%
It's a whole other
thing to monetize it.

01:02:12.190 --> 01:02:16.990 align:middle line:84%
With Fireside, you register,
and you connect on the platform,

01:02:16.990 --> 01:02:19.090 align:middle line:90%
and we know who you are.

01:02:19.090 --> 01:02:20.740 align:middle line:90%
We know what your engagement is.

01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:24.220 align:middle line:84%
You get to give real time
feedback to what's going on.

01:02:24.220 --> 01:02:27.940 align:middle line:84%
And that allows us to
create a level of engagement

01:02:27.940 --> 01:02:29.680 align:middle line:84%
that no one else
has seen before.

01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:32.974 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:02:32.974 --> 01:02:35.470 align:middle line:90%


01:02:35.470 --> 01:02:37.030 align:middle line:84%
So my approach
to, how much money

01:02:37.030 --> 01:02:39.100 align:middle line:84%
do I spend on marketing
or advertising,

01:02:39.100 --> 01:02:42.760 align:middle line:84%
is to try to figure out how
little I can spend in order

01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:44.760 align:middle line:90%
to increase my sales.

01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:47.850 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the mistakes
most companies make,

01:02:47.850 --> 01:02:51.510 align:middle line:84%
large and small, is they
try to buy their sales.

01:02:51.510 --> 01:02:54.960 align:middle line:84%
You should focus
everything you can

01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:57.900 align:middle line:84%
on your next
profitable customer.

01:02:57.900 --> 01:03:02.820 align:middle line:84%
What can I do to get another
customer, make them happy,

01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:05.940 align:middle line:84%
and make them so happy about
their experience or the product

01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:09.150 align:middle line:84%
that they purchased that
I can then go to them

01:03:09.150 --> 01:03:12.450 align:middle line:84%
and ask them to refer
me to other customers?

WHITNEY GATES: I
reached out to Mark

01:03:13.950 --> 01:03:15.690 align:middle line:90%
about our marketing strategy.

01:03:15.690 --> 01:03:20.400 align:middle line:84%
We're obviously looking
to expand the-- our name

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:24.120 align:middle line:84%
nationwide, to build a
more prominent presence.

01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:25.880 align:middle line:84%
And I was-- went to
Mark, and I said,

01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:27.630 align:middle line:84%
hey, Mark, do you have
any examples of how

01:03:27.630 --> 01:03:30.000 align:middle line:84%
any of your brands or any
of the other companies

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:34.260 align:middle line:84%
that you're mentoring have
leveraged social media

01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:37.680 align:middle line:84%
or marketing in any capacity
to help build brand awareness?

01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:39.750 align:middle line:84%
I said, what investments
have they made?

01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:41.430 align:middle line:90%
And he said, don't invest in it.

01:03:41.430 --> 01:03:45.130 align:middle line:84%
Ship some product
for free to some nano

01:03:45.130 --> 01:03:47.170 align:middle line:84%
influencers within
the wine industry.

01:03:47.170 --> 01:03:48.550 align:middle line:90%
He said, go on TikTok.

01:03:48.550 --> 01:03:49.840 align:middle line:90%
Go on Instagram.

01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:54.010 align:middle line:84%
Find some names who represent
your target consumer.

01:03:54.010 --> 01:03:57.880 align:middle line:84%
Ship them some free wine, and
ask them to post about Wondry.

01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:00.550 align:middle line:90%
Don't pay an influencer a dime.

01:04:00.550 --> 01:04:03.610 align:middle line:84%
One thing I always wanted
to try to do for my companies,

01:04:03.610 --> 01:04:06.640 align:middle line:84%
whether I was 24
years old or now,

01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:08.950 align:middle line:84%
is I always wanted to
connect with people

01:04:08.950 --> 01:04:12.370 align:middle line:84%
in the media, people
in the industry who

01:04:12.370 --> 01:04:14.890 align:middle line:84%
are influencers at
some level or another.

01:04:14.890 --> 01:04:18.580 align:middle line:84%
And then, like now, if
there's anything written

01:04:18.580 --> 01:04:23.920 align:middle line:84%
about my industry, I would email
them or DM them saying, look,

01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:25.270 align:middle line:90%
this is my company.

01:04:25.270 --> 01:04:27.670 align:middle line:84%
We are in this industry
that you follow,

01:04:27.670 --> 01:04:31.390 align:middle line:84%
cover, write about, participate
in, whatever it may be.

01:04:31.390 --> 01:04:35.470 align:middle line:84%
You're always looking for
content ideas for your industry

01:04:35.470 --> 01:04:38.590 align:middle line:84%
column, for your podcast,
for your newsletter,

01:04:38.590 --> 01:04:39.940 align:middle line:90%
whatever it may be.

01:04:39.940 --> 01:04:41.830 align:middle line:90%
I can help you with that.

01:04:41.830 --> 01:04:43.720 align:middle line:84%
Let me tell you
about my business.

01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:46.690 align:middle line:84%
You might get 99% nos,
but if you get that one

01:04:46.690 --> 01:04:50.200 align:middle line:84%
yes, that can be a
huge difference-maker,

01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:51.297 align:middle line:90%
and it's free.

01:04:51.297 --> 01:04:53.380 align:middle line:84%
Marketing is absolutely
one of Mark's strengths,

01:04:53.380 --> 01:04:55.420 align:middle line:90%
both marketing and PR.

01:04:55.420 --> 01:04:59.185 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't spend money
on having a PR person.

01:04:59.185 --> 01:05:00.310 align:middle line:90%
He does everything himself.

01:05:00.310 --> 01:05:02.060 align:middle line:84%
He reaches out to every
single journalist.

01:05:02.060 --> 01:05:05.140 align:middle line:84%
If there's a podcast he wants
to be on, he'll reach out.

01:05:05.140 --> 01:05:09.130 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's something that
very much differentiates Mark,

01:05:09.130 --> 01:05:11.800 align:middle line:84%
but he fundamentally believes
that for his businesses,

01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:15.400 align:middle line:84%
investing dollars to
generate marketing outcomes

01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:16.540 align:middle line:90%
is not the right approach.

01:05:16.540 --> 01:05:18.760 align:middle line:84%
The reality is,
with the rise of AI,

01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:22.300 align:middle line:84%
which is ChatGPT, the
way in which people now

01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:26.200 align:middle line:84%
go and search or try to
research a particular topic

01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:28.990 align:middle line:84%
or get information is
changing at a rapid pace.

01:05:28.990 --> 01:05:32.620 align:middle line:84%
So traditional marketing
methods that invest a lot of--

01:05:32.620 --> 01:05:35.140 align:middle line:84%
that require a lot of
upfront investment,

01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:38.020 align:middle line:84%
like SEO or even
paid advertising

01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:41.320 align:middle line:84%
to a certain extent, is not
going to be a sustainable

01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:43.150 align:middle line:90%
use of your time.

01:05:43.150 --> 01:05:45.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, Mark talks a lot
about earned media.

01:05:45.970 --> 01:05:49.240 align:middle line:84%
He talks a lot also about
creating viral products,

01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:50.823 align:middle line:84%
where you just delight
your customers,

01:05:50.823 --> 01:05:52.282 align:middle line:84%
and then through
that, you're going

01:05:52.282 --> 01:05:53.800 align:middle line:84%
to get word of
mouth and referrals.

01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:54.880 align:middle line:90%
He's like, don't spend money.

01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:57.255 align:middle line:84%
Like, figure out how to be
creative about your marketing.

01:05:57.255 --> 01:05:59.640 align:middle line:90%

MARK CUBAN: With
Cost Plus Drugs,

01:06:01.110 --> 01:06:04.020 align:middle line:84%
to be the low cost
provider wherever we can be

01:06:04.020 --> 01:06:06.960 align:middle line:84%
and just sell it
at 15% markup, you

01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:10.770 align:middle line:84%
have to have a marketing
strategy and a marketing plan.

01:06:10.770 --> 01:06:12.990 align:middle line:90%
And we absolutely did.

01:06:12.990 --> 01:06:17.340 align:middle line:84%
We decided we were going to
do zero marketing and zero

01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:19.620 align:middle line:84%
advertising, and
the total amount

01:06:19.620 --> 01:06:22.560 align:middle line:84%
of money we have spent
since inception on marketing

01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:25.020 align:middle line:90%
and advertising is zero.

01:06:25.020 --> 01:06:27.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, how can you get
away with doing that?

01:06:27.630 --> 01:06:30.900 align:middle line:84%
You can get away with that when
your impact on your customers

01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:34.080 align:middle line:84%
is so great, they feel
prideful when they

01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:35.670 align:middle line:90%
tell other people about it.

01:06:35.670 --> 01:06:38.460 align:middle line:84%
So if there's a
patient that's using--

01:06:38.460 --> 01:06:40.800 align:middle line:84%
that's buying imatinib
from us, and they

01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:46.530 align:middle line:84%
had been paying $2,000, and now
they're paying $41 or whatever,

01:06:46.530 --> 01:06:48.390 align:middle line:84%
what's the first thing
they're going to do?

01:06:48.390 --> 01:06:51.120 align:middle line:84%
After celebrating, they're going
to tell everybody else they

01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:54.870 align:middle line:84%
know that has the same
affliction, hey, you gotta

01:06:54.870 --> 01:06:56.640 align:middle line:84%
start buying from
Cost Plus Drugs

01:06:56.640 --> 01:06:59.320 align:middle line:84%
if you don't have insurance
or your deductible

01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:03.010 align:middle line:84%
is higher than $41,
which is a lot of people.

01:07:03.010 --> 01:07:05.200 align:middle line:90%
Don't ever try to buy sales.

01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:08.200 align:middle line:84%
If you have to buy
sales, something's wrong.

01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:10.120 align:middle line:90%
Something is absolutely wrong.

01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:11.440 align:middle line:90%
And I see this all the time.

01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:13.540 align:middle line:84%
I was looking at a
set of financials

01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:16.447 align:middle line:84%
for a company I
invested in, and they

01:07:16.447 --> 01:07:18.280 align:middle line:84%
had a quarter where
their sales didn't go up

01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:19.870 align:middle line:90%
as much as they had budgeted.

01:07:19.870 --> 01:07:22.750 align:middle line:84%
And they had spent just
what they had expected

01:07:22.750 --> 01:07:26.470 align:middle line:84%
to on advertising, and then the
next quarter, I was like, wow,

01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:28.060 align:middle line:90%
your sales really went up.

01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:30.250 align:middle line:90%
They went up 17%.

01:07:30.250 --> 01:07:32.110 align:middle line:84%
But then I looked at
their marketing budget,

01:07:32.110 --> 01:07:37.030 align:middle line:84%
and they had spent 27%
to get that 17% increase.

01:07:37.030 --> 01:07:38.530 align:middle line:90%
They were buying sales.

01:07:38.530 --> 01:07:41.110 align:middle line:84%
That's always a
mistake in my mind.

01:07:41.110 --> 01:07:43.720 align:middle line:84%
If you're just trying to grow,
grow, grow, grow, grow, grow,

01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:45.100 align:middle line:84%
grow, spend, spend,
spend, spend,

01:07:45.100 --> 01:07:48.130 align:middle line:84%
spend to get that growth,
and you're not there or don't

01:07:48.130 --> 01:07:50.740 align:middle line:84%
have a direct path
to profitability,

01:07:50.740 --> 01:07:53.350 align:middle line:84%
if something goes wrong,
you're out of business.

01:07:53.350 --> 01:07:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's why you see
so many companies fail.

01:07:56.940 --> 01:08:00.660 align:middle line:84%
They spent just to grow their
sales, blow through their cash

01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:04.410 align:middle line:84%
so fast there's none left, and
when it's all said and done,

01:08:04.410 --> 01:08:06.990 align:middle line:84%
hey, we were a $20
million in sales company,

01:08:06.990 --> 01:08:09.450 align:middle line:84%
but we went out of business
because those sales weren't

01:08:09.450 --> 01:08:09.990 align:middle line:90%
profitable.

01:08:09.990 --> 01:08:10.990 align:middle line:90%
Don't make that mistake.

01:08:10.990 --> 01:08:14.152 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:08:14.152 --> 01:08:16.540 align:middle line:90%


01:08:16.540 --> 01:08:20.319 align:middle line:84%
One of the biggest mistakes I
think some entrepreneurs make

01:08:20.319 --> 01:08:22.600 align:middle line:84%
as they're up and coming
is thinking of themselves

01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:24.069 align:middle line:90%
as a brand.

01:08:24.069 --> 01:08:28.720 align:middle line:84%
And I say this to the Mavericks,
our marketing people there,

01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:30.880 align:middle line:84%
and I've said it to
a lot of companies.

01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:34.090 align:middle line:84%
Presenting yourself as a
brand is counterproductive.

01:08:34.090 --> 01:08:37.359 align:middle line:84%
It hurts more than it helps
because you're overselling,

01:08:37.359 --> 01:08:41.109 align:middle line:84%
and it's forced, and
it's not organic.

01:08:41.109 --> 01:08:44.290 align:middle line:90%
Brand recognition is earned.

01:08:44.290 --> 01:08:46.540 align:middle line:90%
It's not forced or created.

01:08:46.540 --> 01:08:49.359 align:middle line:84%
It has to be organic
and authentic.

01:08:49.359 --> 01:08:53.319 align:middle line:84%
So as an entrepreneur,
if you hope someday

01:08:53.319 --> 01:08:57.640 align:middle line:84%
that you could be, you know,
on the Bill Gates, Elon Musk,

01:08:57.640 --> 01:08:59.560 align:middle line:84%
Warren Buffett
spectrum, it's not

01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:01.420 align:middle line:84%
something you can
promote your way to.

01:09:01.420 --> 01:09:02.319 align:middle line:90%
It's just not.

01:09:02.319 --> 01:09:05.710 align:middle line:84%
It's something you have to earn
organically through the things

01:09:05.710 --> 01:09:07.569 align:middle line:84%
that you do, the
things that you say.

01:09:07.569 --> 01:09:09.310 align:middle line:90%
It's through your execution.

01:09:09.310 --> 01:09:10.930 align:middle line:84%
It's through your
accomplishments.

01:09:10.930 --> 01:09:13.600 align:middle line:84%
And particularly now in a
social media environment,

01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:16.520 align:middle line:84%
they write the good things you
do and the bad things you do,

01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:19.640 align:middle line:84%
for better or worse, and that
defines your brand, not you.

01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:23.000 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.370 align:middle line:90%


01:09:26.370 --> 01:09:29.550 align:middle line:84%
If someone comes to me and asks
me to help them evaluate risk,

01:09:29.550 --> 01:09:30.779 align:middle line:90%
yeah, it hasn't been so long.

01:09:30.779 --> 01:09:35.069 align:middle line:84%
I'm not so removed from being
broke that I can't put myself

01:09:35.069 --> 01:09:35.920 align:middle line:90%
in their shoes.

01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:37.170 align:middle line:90%
I talked to someone yesterday.

01:09:37.170 --> 01:09:40.120 align:middle line:84%
Someone came up to me
yesterday, and he says,

01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:42.090 align:middle line:84%
I want to buy your
time because I

01:09:42.090 --> 01:09:45.993 align:middle line:84%
want you to help me try to
figure out why I haven't been

01:09:45.993 --> 01:09:47.160 align:middle line:90%
able to start this business.

01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:48.540 align:middle line:90%
I've got the mortgage.

01:09:48.540 --> 01:09:50.250 align:middle line:90%
I've got expenses.

01:09:50.250 --> 01:09:52.830 align:middle line:84%
I've got some money in the
bank but not quite enough

01:09:52.830 --> 01:09:54.090 align:middle line:90%
to start a company.

01:09:54.090 --> 01:09:57.120 align:middle line:84%
And I told him, well, you've
already answered your question

01:09:57.120 --> 01:09:59.880 align:middle line:84%
because if it was
truly important to you,

01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:02.740 align:middle line:84%
you would have already gone
to your family and said,

01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:04.180 align:middle line:90%
this is my goal.

01:10:04.180 --> 01:10:07.530 align:middle line:84%
Would you please be
willing to cut back

01:10:07.530 --> 01:10:09.210 align:middle line:90%
on this, this, this, and this?

01:10:09.210 --> 01:10:12.000 align:middle line:84%
Am I willing to give
up what I have now?

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.160 align:middle line:84%
Because at some point in
every one of our lives,

01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:17.430 align:middle line:84%
we realize the most valuable
asset we don't own is our time.

01:10:17.430 --> 01:10:19.230 align:middle line:84%
Are you willing to
give up the time?

01:10:19.230 --> 01:10:21.127 align:middle line:84%
Are you willing to
go to your family

01:10:21.127 --> 01:10:22.710 align:middle line:84%
and tell them, there's
not going to be

01:10:22.710 --> 01:10:25.780 align:middle line:90%
work-life balance anymore?

01:10:25.780 --> 01:10:30.130 align:middle line:84%
Those are the things that tend
to stop us more than anything.

01:10:30.130 --> 01:10:34.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, for me, with three kids,
I evaluate risk differently

01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:38.440 align:middle line:84%
because my most
valuable asset is time

01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:42.580 align:middle line:84%
because risk evaluation is
more about deciding if you're

01:10:42.580 --> 01:10:45.160 align:middle line:90%
all in than anything else.

01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:48.850 align:middle line:84%
That is really the risk
evaluation for me now.

01:10:48.850 --> 01:10:50.740 align:middle line:90%
Am I willing to be all in?

01:10:50.740 --> 01:10:53.140 align:middle line:84%
And it has to be something
really special for me

01:10:53.140 --> 01:10:54.340 align:middle line:90%
to do that?

01:10:54.340 --> 01:10:57.040 align:middle line:84%
Billionaire
entrepreneur, Mark Cuban,

01:10:57.040 --> 01:10:59.980 align:middle line:84%
is a man of many faces,
titles, and businesses,

01:10:59.980 --> 01:11:02.770 align:middle line:84%
but there is one other
job title he is eyeing--

01:11:02.770 --> 01:11:04.840 align:middle line:84%
the president of
the United States.

01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:08.320 align:middle line:84%
I get lots of opportunities
to give to politicians.

01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:13.510 align:middle line:84%
Since the year 2000, I've never
given to a politician or a PAC

01:11:13.510 --> 01:11:14.710 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

01:11:14.710 --> 01:11:17.800 align:middle line:90%
And the reason I don't is--

01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:20.170 align:middle line:84%
and I tell this to every
politician who asks--

01:11:20.170 --> 01:11:23.770 align:middle line:84%
either you value my
ideas or you don't.

01:11:23.770 --> 01:11:27.160 align:middle line:84%
I don't want anything to
be influenced by any money

01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:28.000 align:middle line:90%
that I give you.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.760 align:middle line:84%
I don't want-- I don't
want to buy your interest.

01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:33.610 align:middle line:84%
Either it's the
quality of my idea,

01:11:33.610 --> 01:11:35.890 align:middle line:84%
or we don't have
to work together.

01:11:35.890 --> 01:11:37.210 align:middle line:90%
That's fine by me.

01:11:37.210 --> 01:11:39.910 align:middle line:84%
My generation, the sex,
drugs, and rock 'n'

01:11:39.910 --> 01:11:43.960 align:middle line:84%
roll generation to have evolved
into the Fox News generation

01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:46.390 align:middle line:90%
is the tragedy of a lifetime.

01:11:46.390 --> 01:11:48.220 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's just-- it's--

01:11:48.220 --> 01:11:50.080 align:middle line:84%
never would've I
thought when talking

01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:53.140 align:middle line:84%
to dudes with long hair
running around naked,

01:11:53.140 --> 01:11:56.800 align:middle line:84%
let yourself be free, did I
think we'd get to this point.

01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:58.570 align:middle line:84%
If you had asked me
way back when when I

01:11:58.570 --> 01:12:03.370 align:middle line:84%
was a kid what 2023 would look
like, freedom, right, this

01:12:03.370 --> 01:12:05.590 align:middle line:84%
and that, and, you
know, accept everybody,

01:12:05.590 --> 01:12:08.260 align:middle line:90%
and tune out whatever.

01:12:08.260 --> 01:12:10.200 align:middle line:84%
Oh, my god, how the
hell did we get here?

01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:11.950 align:middle line:84%
Another billionaire
toying with the idea

01:12:11.950 --> 01:12:13.450 align:middle line:84%
of running for
president, Mark Cuban

01:12:13.450 --> 01:12:16.480 align:middle line:84%
tells the New York Daily News he
has not decided on anything yet

01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:18.400 align:middle line:84%
but says if the
circumstances were right,

01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:20.830 align:middle line:84%
he would run for president
as an independent.

01:12:20.830 --> 01:12:25.570 align:middle line:84%
In terms of running for
president, probably for--

01:12:25.570 --> 01:12:29.230 align:middle line:84%
from the minute Donald Trump
came down the escalator,

01:12:29.230 --> 01:12:31.900 align:middle line:90%
I had people asking me if--

01:12:31.900 --> 01:12:34.990 align:middle line:84%
if I would do it, you know,
to try to compete with him.

01:12:34.990 --> 01:12:37.780 align:middle line:84%
The entrepreneur in me
saw it as a possibility

01:12:37.780 --> 01:12:40.720 align:middle line:84%
because I've known him for
a long time-- not a fan.

01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:42.520 align:middle line:90%
That was the entire motivation.

01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:45.340 align:middle line:84%
I think working
families in this country

01:12:45.340 --> 01:12:49.030 align:middle line:84%
felt like they were promised a
better situation, less stress,

01:12:49.030 --> 01:12:51.580 align:middle line:84%
higher wages, and I don't
think he knows how to deliver.

01:12:51.580 --> 01:12:52.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm an independent.

01:12:52.630 --> 01:12:54.940 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't run
with either party.

01:12:54.940 --> 01:12:57.610 align:middle line:84%
And I took a typical
business approach,

01:12:57.610 --> 01:13:02.680 align:middle line:84%
and somebody
volunteered to do a poll

01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:06.160 align:middle line:84%
to see how I would compare
to all the other candidates,

01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:10.750 align:middle line:84%
and I got like 25%, you know,
which is not bad, actually.

01:13:10.750 --> 01:13:12.640 align:middle line:84%
They said it was
great given that I've

01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:15.010 align:middle line:84%
done no marketing, you know,
didn't put it out there.

01:13:15.010 --> 01:13:17.308 align:middle line:84%
That was just throw my
name into a hat type thing.

01:13:17.308 --> 01:13:19.600 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, as an entrepreneur,
when you see something that's

01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:22.030 align:middle line:84%
been done the same way forever
and is having problems,

01:13:22.030 --> 01:13:25.010 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, you think you can
do better, you think about it.

01:13:25.010 --> 01:13:26.000 align:middle line:90%
And I certainly did.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.280 align:middle line:84%
There were-- there were
all kinds of things

01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:32.250 align:middle line:84%
that went through my mind that
I thought I could improve,

01:13:32.250 --> 01:13:32.750 align:middle line:90%
you know.

01:13:32.750 --> 01:13:38.360 align:middle line:84%
And because of where we are and
because of the contentiousness,

01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:42.560 align:middle line:84%
because of the extremism
and tribalism and the lack

01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:46.280 align:middle line:84%
of trust, we do need
change because what happens

01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:47.150 align:middle line:90%
is there's so--

01:13:47.150 --> 01:13:52.430 align:middle line:84%
people go to their comfort
zones to try to get information.

01:13:52.430 --> 01:13:56.840 align:middle line:84%
And those comfort zones
rarely are objective.

01:13:56.840 --> 01:14:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's how people get
their perceptions and fall

01:14:02.630 --> 01:14:06.260 align:middle line:84%
into their dogmatic
positions, where they're, you

01:14:06.260 --> 01:14:08.840 align:middle line:84%
know, unchangeable
in their mind.

01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:11.000 align:middle line:84%
And the only way
to overcome that is

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:12.890 align:middle line:84%
to have uncomfortable
conversations and go

01:14:12.890 --> 01:14:14.540 align:middle line:84%
places where
they're not welcome,

01:14:14.540 --> 01:14:16.340 align:middle line:84%
to talk to people
who don't like them,

01:14:16.340 --> 01:14:18.110 align:middle line:90%
to talk to people who hate them.

01:14:18.110 --> 01:14:19.640 align:middle line:90%
You know, even when--

01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:22.310 align:middle line:84%
during that period
in 2016 and 2017,

01:14:22.310 --> 01:14:27.010 align:middle line:84%
I rarely did interviews on CNN
versus the number of interviews

01:14:27.010 --> 01:14:28.848 align:middle line:84%
I did on Fox with
like a Sean Hannity

01:14:28.848 --> 01:14:30.640 align:middle line:84%
because I love doing
those because they all

01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:31.540 align:middle line:90%
disagree with me.

01:14:31.540 --> 01:14:34.420 align:middle line:84%
Going to places where people
disagree instead of agree

01:14:34.420 --> 01:14:37.870 align:middle line:84%
allows you to come to
some common ground.

01:14:37.870 --> 01:14:39.490 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
what's missing.

01:14:39.490 --> 01:14:42.820 align:middle line:84%
You've got to do what's
uncomfortable to get change.

01:14:42.820 --> 01:14:43.987 align:middle line:90%
My family's an issue, right?

01:14:43.987 --> 01:14:45.862 align:middle line:84%
It's not-- it's not what
people say about me.

01:14:45.862 --> 01:14:47.800 align:middle line:84%
It's what people say
to or about my family.

01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:48.928 align:middle line:90%
That part concerns me.

01:14:48.928 --> 01:14:50.470 align:middle line:84%
If I didn't have to
worry about that,

01:14:50.470 --> 01:14:51.970 align:middle line:90%
I would be an automatic yes.

01:14:51.970 --> 01:14:56.380 align:middle line:84%
I was curious, and I asked my
family, and we took a vote.

01:14:56.380 --> 01:14:59.470 align:middle line:84%
And I was the only
one who said yes.

01:14:59.470 --> 01:15:03.880 align:middle line:84%
And so that shot it
down effectively,

01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:08.230 align:middle line:84%
just, you know, putting
your family, your-- just

01:15:08.230 --> 01:15:11.200 align:middle line:84%
particularly my kids through
that in this day and age,

01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:12.290 align:middle line:90%
I just couldn't do it.

01:15:12.290 --> 01:15:13.720 align:middle line:90%
I just, just could not do it.

01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:16.060 align:middle line:90%
And, you know, with--

01:15:16.060 --> 01:15:18.940 align:middle line:84%
with my kids, at
the age they are,

01:15:18.940 --> 01:15:20.840 align:middle line:84%
knowing it's not
going to be long

01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:23.170 align:middle line:84%
until they're on their
own, that changes

01:15:23.170 --> 01:15:25.180 align:middle line:84%
how I evaluate
everything because I

01:15:25.180 --> 01:15:26.690 align:middle line:90%
want to spend time with them.

01:15:26.690 --> 01:15:31.940 align:middle line:84%
And as you get older and, to
a certain extent, wealthier

01:15:31.940 --> 01:15:34.610 align:middle line:84%
obviously, you just value
your time differently.

01:15:34.610 --> 01:15:37.010 align:middle line:84%
And so now the way
I evaluate risk

01:15:37.010 --> 01:15:39.830 align:middle line:84%
is more what's its
impact on my time

01:15:39.830 --> 01:15:42.860 align:middle line:84%
than what's its impact on my
bank account or my net worth.

01:15:42.860 --> 01:15:45.920 align:middle line:90%

01:15:48.690 --> 01:15:50.850 align:middle line:84%
So if you go to
markcuban.com, you'll

01:15:50.850 --> 01:15:52.770 align:middle line:84%
see I have hundreds
of investments.

01:15:52.770 --> 01:15:54.270 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, I've
got a great staff

01:15:54.270 --> 01:15:56.040 align:middle line:84%
of people who are
very, very smart

01:15:56.040 --> 01:15:58.230 align:middle line:90%
and committed to helping them.

01:15:58.230 --> 01:16:00.210 align:middle line:84%
It's not always
just about you when

01:16:00.210 --> 01:16:02.220 align:middle line:84%
you're the CEO or the
founder of a company.

01:16:02.220 --> 01:16:05.400 align:middle line:84%
You have to also look at the
organization you're running.

01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:07.500 align:middle line:84%
How can I make the
company smarter?

01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:12.330 align:middle line:84%
How can I align with the mindset
of everybody who reports to me,

01:16:12.330 --> 01:16:13.860 align:middle line:90%
everybody within the company?

01:16:13.860 --> 01:16:16.920 align:middle line:84%
How can I define a
culture that values

01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:20.520 align:middle line:84%
growth and success and
performance and improvement?

01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:24.000 align:middle line:84%
That's not easy to do because
as your company grows,

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.040 align:middle line:84%
all these challenges
get greater.

01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:31.560 align:middle line:84%
And so I always try to focus
on being open to change,

01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:34.110 align:middle line:84%
being able to communicate,
and being nice.

01:16:34.110 --> 01:16:37.230 align:middle line:84%
These are all the things that
allow me to work with people

01:16:37.230 --> 01:16:40.800 align:middle line:84%
and try to align their mission
with our company mission

01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:42.780 align:middle line:90%
and always get smarter better.

01:16:42.780 --> 01:16:45.450 align:middle line:84%
What makes mark an
entrepreneurial disruptor

01:16:45.450 --> 01:16:49.270 align:middle line:84%
is his unconventional approach
to everything that he does.

01:16:49.270 --> 01:16:51.993 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing that Mark
does that is like anybody else.

01:16:51.993 --> 01:16:53.410 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell
you a little thing

01:16:53.410 --> 01:16:56.170 align:middle line:84%
that I do for all of
my companies and some

01:16:56.170 --> 01:16:57.550 align:middle line:90%
that I invest in.

01:16:57.550 --> 01:17:02.080 align:middle line:84%
There's always going
to be a customer email

01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:04.990 align:middle line:84%
address, right--
info@whatevercompany.com,

01:17:04.990 --> 01:17:07.990 align:middle line:84%
problem or
support@whatevercompany.com.

01:17:07.990 --> 01:17:11.620 align:middle line:84%
And every single time,
those emails come to me.

01:17:11.620 --> 01:17:13.030 align:middle line:90%
They don't go to somebody else.

01:17:13.030 --> 01:17:17.170 align:middle line:84%
They come to me because I want
to know every single problem

01:17:17.170 --> 01:17:19.120 align:middle line:90%
that our customers are having.

01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:21.040 align:middle line:84%
And you know who's going
to respond to that?

01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:23.020 align:middle line:84%
Me, because when
you're interacting

01:17:23.020 --> 01:17:25.270 align:middle line:84%
with your customers, one,
you get to learn everything,

01:17:25.270 --> 01:17:26.812 align:middle line:84%
and you get to get
their perspective.

01:17:26.812 --> 01:17:28.240 align:middle line:84%
Two, if things
aren't going well,

01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:29.470 align:middle line:90%
you get to fix the problem.

01:17:29.470 --> 01:17:32.050 align:middle line:84%
Three, when they hear
the CEO or the founder

01:17:32.050 --> 01:17:33.940 align:middle line:84%
has just responded
to them or when

01:17:33.940 --> 01:17:36.910 align:middle line:84%
they see they're getting an
email from the founder or CEO,

01:17:36.910 --> 01:17:39.400 align:middle line:84%
they appreciate it,
and they know you care,

01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:41.425 align:middle line:84%
and they will give you
more in-depth answers.

01:17:41.425 --> 01:17:42.400 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:45.520 align:middle line:84%
For me, I'm always
accessible via email.

01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:47.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my email is
available publicly.

01:17:47.410 --> 01:17:50.500 align:middle line:84%
And so I get email
pitches all the time.

01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:57.100 align:middle line:84%
I've literally invested $100
million in email pitches

01:17:57.100 --> 01:17:58.270 align:middle line:90%
that people have sent me.

01:17:58.270 --> 01:18:00.490 align:middle line:84%
Some of them I still
have not met the people.

01:18:00.490 --> 01:18:02.680 align:middle line:84%
And they'll be like,
well, let's set up a call.

01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:04.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, no, I don't do calls.

01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:07.212 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'll engage with
you via email, and trust me,

01:18:07.212 --> 01:18:08.170 align:middle line:90%
I do this all the time.

01:18:08.170 --> 01:18:09.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm really good at it.

01:18:09.250 --> 01:18:11.470 align:middle line:84%
I'll give you more
comprehensive responses

01:18:11.470 --> 01:18:13.510 align:middle line:90%
than if it was via phone.

01:18:13.510 --> 01:18:15.323 align:middle line:84%
And if we do it by
phone, I'm going

01:18:15.323 --> 01:18:17.740 align:middle line:84%
to forget half the stuff that
we talked about because I've

01:18:17.740 --> 01:18:19.150 align:middle line:90%
got so much going on.

01:18:19.150 --> 01:18:21.730 align:middle line:84%
If we do it via email, I
can search for it always.

01:18:21.730 --> 01:18:24.730 align:middle line:84%
And now, even with
Cost Plus, I've

01:18:24.730 --> 01:18:26.710 align:middle line:84%
convinced Alex to
do fewer meetings.

01:18:26.710 --> 01:18:31.360 align:middle line:84%
But now, we record the
meetings and run them

01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:36.820 align:middle line:84%
through a transcriber and
send them to an email address

01:18:36.820 --> 01:18:40.150 align:middle line:84%
that we've set up so
that we can forward

01:18:40.150 --> 01:18:43.060 align:middle line:84%
the transcriptions of any
calls or meetings we have.

01:18:43.060 --> 01:18:47.860 align:middle line:84%
And we also forward our emails
about business projects that we

01:18:47.860 --> 01:18:52.000 align:middle line:84%
have to the same email
address in expectation that,

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:55.390 align:middle line:84%
at some point, we'll ingest
all that into a large language

01:18:55.390 --> 01:18:57.220 align:middle line:84%
model, an AI large
language model,

01:18:57.220 --> 01:18:59.320 align:middle line:84%
and we'll-- rather than
having to search through

01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:02.350 align:middle line:84%
the individual emails looking
for what we were talking about

01:19:02.350 --> 01:19:05.740 align:middle line:84%
with imatinib or this
vendor or that manufacturer,

01:19:05.740 --> 01:19:09.670 align:middle line:84%
we can just put it into our
own version of ChatGPT and say,

01:19:09.670 --> 01:19:13.210 align:middle line:84%
what did we discuss about
imatinib and our potential

01:19:13.210 --> 01:19:14.560 align:middle line:90%
sales or whatever it may be?

01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:17.710 align:middle line:84%
Email is the primary
communication vehicle

01:19:17.710 --> 01:19:19.120 align:middle line:90%
that Mark uses.

01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:21.250 align:middle line:84%
If you want to try to
get on a call with him

01:19:21.250 --> 01:19:23.140 align:middle line:90%
or a Zoom, good luck.

01:19:23.140 --> 01:19:24.580 align:middle line:90%
It's all email.

01:19:24.580 --> 01:19:26.440 align:middle line:90%
I'm literally in bed for--

01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:29.530 align:middle line:90%
you know, from 630 to 8:00 AM--

01:19:29.530 --> 01:19:30.940 align:middle line:90%
it may be even 8:30--

01:19:30.940 --> 01:19:33.820 align:middle line:84%
because I don't even know
the time is flying by.

01:19:33.820 --> 01:19:36.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm so intense in
responding to the issues

01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:39.460 align:middle line:84%
I have to address
that I'm just focused

01:19:39.460 --> 01:19:40.900 align:middle line:90%
on that and not anything else.

01:19:40.900 --> 01:19:44.140 align:middle line:84%
Then, from there, typically
I'll go to the gym for an hour

01:19:44.140 --> 01:19:46.720 align:middle line:84%
and come back and
rinse and repeat.

01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:49.390 align:middle line:84%
And the rest of the
day, I'll be working

01:19:49.390 --> 01:19:51.730 align:middle line:84%
on emails, if I have any
calls, which is typically

01:19:51.730 --> 01:19:52.510 align:middle line:90%
not the case.

01:19:52.510 --> 01:19:54.550 align:middle line:90%
My kids will get home.

01:19:54.550 --> 01:19:57.070 align:middle line:84%
I'll try to convince my
teenagers to talk to me.

01:19:57.070 --> 01:19:59.800 align:middle line:84%
That is the most difficult
job I have during the day.

01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:01.765 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll go back
to answering emails

01:20:01.765 --> 01:20:02.890 align:middle line:90%
unless there's a Mavs game.

01:20:02.890 --> 01:20:06.120 align:middle line:90%
[CHATTER]

01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:14.102 align:middle line:90%


01:20:14.102 --> 01:20:16.310 align:middle line:84%
Different networks, so if
I don't have good reception

01:20:16.310 --> 01:20:18.830 align:middle line:90%
from one, and then if I--

01:20:18.830 --> 01:20:21.560 align:middle line:84%
if something's downloading or
something's going on on one

01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:23.330 align:middle line:84%
or I'm waiting for
somebody or something,

01:20:23.330 --> 01:20:26.510 align:middle line:84%
I've got to use
another one to work on.

01:20:26.510 --> 01:20:29.130 align:middle line:84%
To be honest-- and Mark
is probably going to laugh

01:20:29.130 --> 01:20:29.630 align:middle line:90%
at this--

01:20:29.630 --> 01:20:31.940 align:middle line:84%
I probably spend
about 1 to 2 hours

01:20:31.940 --> 01:20:35.180 align:middle line:84%
crafting a three-sentence
email to Mark Cuban.

01:20:35.180 --> 01:20:38.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm focused on crafting
the perfect headline

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.100 align:middle line:84%
and the bullets-- only
bullets because Mark

01:20:40.100 --> 01:20:42.740 align:middle line:84%
does not-- you don't put
a novel together for Mark.

01:20:42.740 --> 01:20:44.840 align:middle line:90%
He's not going to read it.

01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:46.850 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I'm a low EQ guy.

01:20:46.850 --> 01:20:48.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to be
a higher EQ guy.

01:20:48.860 --> 01:20:52.250 align:middle line:84%
I work on it, but I'm
like, bam, bam, bam, bam,

01:20:52.250 --> 01:20:53.030 align:middle line:90%
bam, to the point.

01:20:53.030 --> 01:20:55.280 align:middle line:84%
If you ask people in
my portfolio companies

01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:59.240 align:middle line:84%
or who work with me or for
me what my response style is,

01:20:59.240 --> 01:21:01.220 align:middle line:84%
they're going to say,
right to the point.

01:21:01.220 --> 01:21:03.380 align:middle line:84%
You can send Mark an email
at 2:00 in the morning,

01:21:03.380 --> 01:21:06.860 align:middle line:84%
and he might respond at 2:01,
but it'll be five words.

01:21:06.860 --> 01:21:09.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to say, hey,
let's get on the phone

01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:10.360 align:middle line:90%
and chat it out.

01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:12.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to say, let's
get together and have a beer

01:21:12.990 --> 01:21:14.400 align:middle line:90%
and figure it out.

01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:16.350 align:middle line:90%
That's-- that's just me, right?

01:21:16.350 --> 01:21:19.193 align:middle line:84%
That's my style, particularly
at this point in my life.

01:21:19.193 --> 01:21:21.360 align:middle line:84%
But everybody's got to pick
their own style and what

01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:22.050 align:middle line:90%
works for them.

01:21:22.050 --> 01:21:23.592 align:middle line:84%
You've got to play
to your strengths.

01:21:23.592 --> 01:21:25.680 align:middle line:84%
My strengths are getting
right to the point

01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:27.732 align:middle line:90%
and coming up with a solution.

01:21:27.732 --> 01:21:29.940 align:middle line:84%
Whatever works for you,
that's what you've got to do.

01:21:29.940 --> 01:21:31.620 align:middle line:90%
You can't try to replicate me.

01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:34.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to try
to replicate you.

01:21:34.590 --> 01:21:35.830 align:middle line:90%
So here's an interesting one.

01:21:35.830 --> 01:21:38.400 align:middle line:84%
A guy named Chris has got
an interesting pitch, who

01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:41.070 align:middle line:84%
I responded to this morning
while we were waiting earlier.

01:21:41.070 --> 01:21:43.320 align:middle line:84%
And basically, what
his pitch was--

01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:48.060 align:middle line:84%
that we can listen to the
grumblings in our stomach,

01:21:48.060 --> 01:21:51.930 align:middle line:84%
and there's actually a unique
noise that our guts make

01:21:51.930 --> 01:21:53.550 align:middle line:90%
when they're in distress.

01:21:53.550 --> 01:21:57.450 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, how do you
capture this, right, because--

01:21:57.450 --> 01:22:00.090 align:middle line:84%
what I told him, when I wrote
back to him, I'll tell you.

01:22:00.090 --> 01:22:02.100 align:middle line:84%
I said, "My initial
thought was that you

01:22:02.100 --> 01:22:04.350 align:middle line:84%
would use off-the-shelf
microphones to record whatever

01:22:04.350 --> 01:22:07.630 align:middle line:84%
you could in a quiet environment
and using ML, machine learning,

01:22:07.630 --> 01:22:10.410 align:middle line:84%
to compare outcomes to determine
which outcome is the greatest

01:22:10.410 --> 01:22:11.157 align:middle line:90%
probability.

01:22:11.157 --> 01:22:13.490 align:middle line:84%
It could be as simple as
having people hold their phones

01:22:13.490 --> 01:22:16.160 align:middle line:84%
next to their stomachs to
record what they can record

01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:17.930 align:middle line:84%
and sending you the
MP3 or WAV file.

01:22:17.930 --> 01:22:19.520 align:middle line:90%
Is this possible?"

01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:21.825 align:middle line:90%
That's what I wrote.

01:22:21.825 --> 01:22:23.450 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, because if you
can make it work--

01:22:23.450 --> 01:22:25.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just think
about it, right?

01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:28.190 align:middle line:84%
We've all had upset
stomachs, and we all

01:22:28.190 --> 01:22:30.110 align:middle line:84%
use conventional wisdom
to deal with it--

01:22:30.110 --> 01:22:32.240 align:middle line:84%
Pepto-Bismol or
whatever, chicken soup,

01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:35.120 align:middle line:84%
whatever it may be, but
we don't really know.

01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:40.160 align:middle line:84%
And there's so much uncertainty
to resolving these issues,

01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:41.960 align:middle line:90%
so it might be a plausible idea.

01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:43.790 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I
think it's plausible--

01:22:43.790 --> 01:22:46.340 align:middle line:84%
I actually have a portfolio
company, Genetesis

01:22:46.340 --> 01:22:49.070 align:middle line:84%
out of Cincinnati, and this
was a 21-year-old doctor

01:22:49.070 --> 01:22:50.330 align:middle line:90%
who sent me a cold email.

01:22:50.330 --> 01:22:53.330 align:middle line:84%
And what he said
in his email was

01:22:53.330 --> 01:22:58.250 align:middle line:84%
that every organ in the human
body emits an electrical pulse.

01:22:58.250 --> 01:23:01.460 align:middle line:84%
It was that as a foundation
that helps me understand

01:23:01.460 --> 01:23:04.370 align:middle line:84%
and that I've learned
if you can use those

01:23:04.370 --> 01:23:07.820 align:middle line:84%
sounds to determine a
probability of potential heart

01:23:07.820 --> 01:23:10.910 align:middle line:84%
outcomes, maybe you can do the
same thing for potential gut

01:23:10.910 --> 01:23:12.050 align:middle line:90%
outcomes.

01:23:12.050 --> 01:23:13.058 align:middle line:90%
You asked.

No.

01:23:23.770 --> 01:23:25.540 align:middle line:84%
No, I don't see
myself ev-- you know,

01:23:25.540 --> 01:23:30.010 align:middle line:84%
I retired the first time because
I wanted to party and travel.

01:23:30.010 --> 01:23:33.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, I see it as
what keeps me young.

01:23:33.580 --> 01:23:36.190 align:middle line:84%
It used to be I was the
youngest walking in the door,

01:23:36.190 --> 01:23:38.350 align:middle line:84%
and I used to have
to convince somebody

01:23:38.350 --> 01:23:41.350 align:middle line:84%
that as a 24 or
25-year-old, I could

01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:42.730 align:middle line:90%
compete with a 40-year-old.

01:23:42.730 --> 01:23:46.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, where I'm at now, I got
to convince the 25-year-old

01:23:46.210 --> 01:23:48.190 align:middle line:84%
that I can kick their
ass, and that's fun.

But at some point in
every entrepreneur's life,

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.700 align:middle line:90%
they think about an exit.

01:23:54.700 --> 01:23:57.520 align:middle line:84%
And if you're in a
position where you may get

01:23:57.520 --> 01:24:00.190 align:middle line:84%
offers or are looking for
offers, whether or not

01:24:00.190 --> 01:24:02.620 align:middle line:84%
you accept that offer
falls into two categories.

01:24:02.620 --> 01:24:06.090 align:middle line:84%
There's an offer that
says, okay, you know,

01:24:06.090 --> 01:24:07.840 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to run
this business anymore.

01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:10.930 align:middle line:84%
That's good because I
want to do something else,

01:24:10.930 --> 01:24:12.730 align:middle line:84%
and this gives me some
money, or at least I

01:24:12.730 --> 01:24:16.120 align:middle line:84%
get some money back for this
company, and that's okay too.

01:24:16.120 --> 01:24:20.090 align:middle line:84%
And then there are offers
where it's life-altering.

01:24:20.090 --> 01:24:22.700 align:middle line:84%
One of America's most
famous professional sports

01:24:22.700 --> 01:24:26.240 align:middle line:84%
owners is selling his
beloved team mark Cuban

01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:28.520 align:middle line:84%
may be selling the
Dallas Mavericks.

01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:31.640 align:middle line:84%
And so if the
answer is yes, you'd

01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:36.140 align:middle line:84%
better think long and hard
because another offer might

01:24:36.140 --> 01:24:37.520 align:middle line:90%
never come along.

01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:40.130 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry about how much.

01:24:40.130 --> 01:24:42.710 align:middle line:90%
Worry about what happens next.

01:24:42.710 --> 01:24:45.080 align:middle line:84%
How does this change your
life and your family's life?

01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:49.068 align:middle line:84%
And if you keep all those--
keep those things in mind,

01:24:49.068 --> 01:24:50.360 align:middle line:90%
you'll make the right decision.

In trying to determine what
your business is worth,

01:24:58.070 --> 01:25:00.710 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be a couple
of different options.

01:25:00.710 --> 01:25:05.120 align:middle line:84%
They divide buyers into
basically two categories--

01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:07.850 align:middle line:84%
financial buyers and
strategic buyers.

01:25:07.850 --> 01:25:11.750 align:middle line:84%
A financial buyer will
say, look, your industry,

01:25:11.750 --> 01:25:15.830 align:middle line:84%
public companies are trading
at 10 times annual cash flow.

about the strategic value.

01:25:28.250 --> 01:25:30.560 align:middle line:84%
another widget that's going
to be double super special.

01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:31.760 align:middle line:90%
I don't care about that.

01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:33.470 align:middle line:84%
When we buy a
business like yours,

01:25:33.470 --> 01:25:35.450 align:middle line:90%
we pay 10 times cash flow.

01:25:35.450 --> 01:25:37.160 align:middle line:90%
That's a financial buyer.

01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:40.760 align:middle line:84%
A strategic buyer is, oh,
my goodness, your widget

01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:43.430 align:middle line:84%
could really help our
company, and you're telling me

01:25:43.430 --> 01:25:46.520 align:middle line:84%
your next version of your
widget can do A, B, and C,

01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:48.860 align:middle line:84%
which is going to allow
us to better compete

01:25:48.860 --> 01:25:50.750 align:middle line:90%
with our competitors.

01:25:50.750 --> 01:25:53.960 align:middle line:84%
Then I'm not-- I'm not really
concerned with what the market

01:25:53.960 --> 01:25:55.010 align:middle line:90%
multiple is.

01:25:55.010 --> 01:25:56.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm concerned that
one of my competitors

01:25:56.900 --> 01:26:01.320 align:middle line:84%
might get you before I do
and become strategic to them

01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:02.440 align:middle line:90%
and hurt us.

01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:05.340 align:middle line:84%
So that's a strategic buyer,
and the preference is always

01:26:05.340 --> 01:26:06.465 align:middle line:90%
to find a strategic buyer.

01:26:06.465 --> 01:26:10.213 align:middle line:90%

01:26:11.615 --> 01:26:13.240 align:middle line:84%
Living in the United
States of America,

01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:15.160 align:middle line:84%
we talk about the
American dream.

01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:17.350 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
what makes this country

01:26:17.350 --> 01:26:20.350 align:middle line:84%
different than every other
country in the world.

01:26:20.350 --> 01:26:25.120 align:middle line:84%
Where income inequality
grows is when people only

01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:26.680 align:middle line:90%
make the wages they make.

01:26:26.680 --> 01:26:30.340 align:middle line:84%
They have no assets
that can appreciate.

01:26:30.340 --> 01:26:37.420 align:middle line:84%
If you look at where I came
from, neither of my parents

01:26:37.420 --> 01:26:39.040 align:middle line:90%
went to college.

01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:43.060 align:middle line:84%
And my dad, he, you
know, did upholstery

01:26:43.060 --> 01:26:45.460 align:middle line:84%
on cars, lost an
eye in an accident.

01:26:45.460 --> 01:26:50.530 align:middle line:84%
You know, a staple broke and hit
him in the eye when I was 11.

01:26:50.530 --> 01:26:55.180 align:middle line:84%
Six days a week, you know,
it was-- it was brutal,

01:26:55.180 --> 01:26:59.800 align:middle line:84%
and he never made more than
$40,000 a year in his life.

01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:02.950 align:middle line:84%
But still, my dad is
a super emotional guy.

01:27:02.950 --> 01:27:06.220 align:middle line:84%
He's a hugger--
passed that along

01:27:06.220 --> 01:27:09.130 align:middle line:84%
to me, which my kids
don't always like,

01:27:09.130 --> 01:27:10.420 align:middle line:90%
like I didn't always like.

01:27:10.420 --> 01:27:16.210 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, my dad, you know, if
you smiled, he would hug you.

01:27:16.210 --> 01:27:20.142 align:middle line:84%
When I first told my dad
how much money I was making,

01:27:20.142 --> 01:27:21.100 align:middle line:90%
he just started crying.

01:27:21.100 --> 01:27:25.570 align:middle line:90%


01:27:25.570 --> 01:27:27.410 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:27:27.410 --> 01:27:29.300 align:middle line:90%
And then from there, as--

01:27:29.300 --> 01:27:31.470 align:middle line:84%
you know, as things
really started to happen,

01:27:31.470 --> 01:27:33.380 align:middle line:84%
you know, I'd take our
family on vacations.

01:27:33.380 --> 01:27:37.490 align:middle line:84%
And then it was like, okay, Mom,
Dad, wherever you want to go,

01:27:37.490 --> 01:27:38.360 align:middle line:90%
you could go.

01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:40.790 align:middle line:90%
Take my brothers, whoever.

01:27:40.790 --> 01:27:43.580 align:middle line:84%
Just do whatever you
want, Carte Blanche.

01:27:43.580 --> 01:27:46.310 align:middle line:84%
And my mom would
never spend money.

01:27:46.310 --> 01:27:50.750 align:middle line:84%
You know, they were
Depression kids and, you know,

01:27:50.750 --> 01:27:54.290 align:middle line:84%
grew up thinking whatever money
you have was going to be gone.

01:27:54.290 --> 01:27:56.450 align:middle line:84%
And so my mom
wouldn't spend money.

01:27:56.450 --> 01:27:58.340 align:middle line:90%
My dad was happy to.

01:27:58.340 --> 01:28:00.230 align:middle line:90%
A bottle of wine, go on a trip--

01:28:00.230 --> 01:28:03.770 align:middle line:84%
they went everywhere
around the world.

01:28:03.770 --> 01:28:07.850 align:middle line:84%
My dad passed away about five
years ago, so he got to see,

01:28:07.850 --> 01:28:10.890 align:middle line:84%
you know, everything
happen, and my mom as well.

01:28:10.890 --> 01:28:14.150 align:middle line:84%
So it was-- it was
something special.

01:28:14.150 --> 01:28:16.730 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I'm just glad they
were able to enjoy it.

01:28:16.730 --> 01:28:20.594 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:28:20.594 --> 01:28:21.560 align:middle line:90%


01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:24.980 align:middle line:84%
As an entrepreneur, when
you start a company,

01:28:24.980 --> 01:28:26.870 align:middle line:90%
you can have an impact.

01:28:26.870 --> 01:28:28.160 align:middle line:90%
And I'm blessed.

01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:31.250 align:middle line:84%
I get to have some impact
along the way in how

01:28:31.250 --> 01:28:35.360 align:middle line:84%
I hire the companies I invest
in, the support I give them.

01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:37.550 align:middle line:84%
Every single company
that I've started,

01:28:37.550 --> 01:28:40.250 align:middle line:84%
everybody in that
company got stuck.

01:28:40.250 --> 01:28:43.760 align:middle line:84%
And so when I sold
MicroSolutions, everybody got--

01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:44.960 align:middle line:90%
got paid, right?

01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:48.140 align:middle line:84%
When I sold broadcast.com,
out of 330 employees,

01:28:48.140 --> 01:28:50.360 align:middle line:84%
300 became millionaires,
and the other 30

01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:52.040 align:middle line:84%
were only because
they started too late.

01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:54.410 align:middle line:84%
I've actually been at
dinner with him in a variety

01:28:54.410 --> 01:28:56.100 align:middle line:84%
of cities-- people walking
up to him and be like, hey,

01:28:56.100 --> 01:28:57.020 align:middle line:90%
I worked for you.

01:28:57.020 --> 01:28:57.950 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:28:57.950 --> 01:29:01.640 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, we're-- yes,
we're building a business,

01:29:01.640 --> 01:29:03.560 align:middle line:84%
but we're also
building a community.

01:29:03.560 --> 01:29:05.990 align:middle line:84%
You know, it doesn't
help us if we're becoming

01:29:05.990 --> 01:29:09.950 align:middle line:84%
multi-millionaires, but
other people behind us are--

01:29:09.950 --> 01:29:11.900 align:middle line:84%
they don't have these
same opportunities.

01:29:11.900 --> 01:29:13.340 align:middle line:90%
We don't want to see that world.

01:29:13.340 --> 01:29:16.160 align:middle line:84%
Every step along the way,
I've had the opportunity

01:29:16.160 --> 01:29:17.540 align:middle line:90%
to change people's lives.

01:29:17.540 --> 01:29:20.060 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at
income inequality,

01:29:20.060 --> 01:29:26.310 align:middle line:84%
when entrepreneurs and
CEOs give shares of stock

01:29:26.310 --> 01:29:29.580 align:middle line:84%
to their employees, that's how
things change in this country

01:29:29.580 --> 01:29:32.850 align:middle line:84%
because when you have
appreciable assets,

01:29:32.850 --> 01:29:34.770 align:middle line:90%
that's how your net worth grows.

01:29:34.770 --> 01:29:37.380 align:middle line:84%
That's what gives you
stability over the long haul.

01:29:37.380 --> 01:29:40.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I, as an
entrepreneur-- and I always,

01:29:40.980 --> 01:29:44.580 align:middle line:84%
always, always encourage, if
not demand from my companies,

01:29:44.580 --> 01:29:48.210 align:middle line:84%
that they give stock to every
single one of their employees.

01:29:48.210 --> 01:29:51.300 align:middle line:84%
So if things turn
out great, everybody

01:29:51.300 --> 01:29:52.740 align:middle line:90%
shares in that upside.

01:29:52.740 --> 01:29:53.850 align:middle line:90%
It's not hard.

01:29:53.850 --> 01:29:56.880 align:middle line:84%
It's just you got to do it, and
every entrepreneur has a chance

01:29:56.880 --> 01:29:57.960 align:middle line:90%
to have that impact.

01:29:57.960 --> 01:29:59.993 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the
reasons I do "Shark Tank."

01:29:59.993 --> 01:30:01.410 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
reasons I invest

01:30:01.410 --> 01:30:03.540 align:middle line:84%
in people like Falon
and Chaz and Whitney--

01:30:03.540 --> 01:30:06.328 align:middle line:84%
because those are the people,
when it's all said and done,

01:30:06.328 --> 01:30:08.370 align:middle line:84%
they'll train other people,
and they'll encourage

01:30:08.370 --> 01:30:10.680 align:middle line:84%
other entrepreneurs, and
they'll invest in others,

01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:14.150 align:middle line:90%
and that's how things change.

01:30:14.150 --> 01:30:16.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm Mark Cuban, and
this is MasterClass.

01:30:16.600 --> 01:30:18.458 align:middle line:90%

01:30:18.458 --> 01:30:19.250 align:middle line:90%
He came back to me.

01:30:19.250 --> 01:30:21.890 align:middle line:84%
He says, Mark, absolutely,
getting a clean signal

01:30:21.890 --> 01:30:22.880 align:middle line:90%
is a challenge.

01:30:22.880 --> 01:30:25.160 align:middle line:84%
Also, there are some
other challenges-- clean

01:30:25.160 --> 01:30:28.670 align:middle line:84%
connectivity, noninterference
with medical equipment.

01:30:28.670 --> 01:30:31.220 align:middle line:84%
Also, since I'm new to
the health care industry,

01:30:31.220 --> 01:30:33.320 align:middle line:84%
they expect me to get
more work experience.

01:30:33.320 --> 01:30:36.320 align:middle line:84%
So in that case, I'm also
open to getting an internship

01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:37.640 align:middle line:90%
at a med company or such.

01:30:37.640 --> 01:30:38.900 align:middle line:90%
Let me know your thoughts.

01:30:38.900 --> 01:30:41.450 align:middle line:84%
So this guy just went
from a great idea

01:30:41.450 --> 01:30:43.612 align:middle line:84%
that I'm excited with to
tell me he's not qualified

01:30:43.612 --> 01:30:44.570 align:middle line:90%
to do any of this shit.

01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:48.660 align:middle line:90%
So.
